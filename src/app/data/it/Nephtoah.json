(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003224/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003224/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003224/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 18:11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003224/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;15</a>) This spring is usually identified with the one at Lifta (&#x2BD;En Neftoah), to the E of Kiriath-jearim and about 4&#xA0;km (2.5&#xA0;mi) WNW of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Although this identification would agree with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003224/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 15:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003224/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Joshua 18:15, 16</a> appears to place &#x201C;the spring of the waters of Nephtoah&#x201D; W of Kiriath-jearim. Bible translators have variously handled this seeming discrepancy. Following the reading of the Greek <em>Septuagint, The Jerusalem Bible </em>replaces &#x201C;westward&#x201D; with &#x201C;towards Gasin.&#x201D; In the <em>Revised Standard Version </em>the text has been changed in harmony with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003224/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 15:9</a> and reads &#x201C;to Ephron&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;westward.&#x201D; Ronald A.&#xA0;Knox translates the Hebrew word <em>yam&#x2B9;mah </em>(westward) according to its literal meaning as &#x201C;seaward&#x201D; and, in a footnote, explains: &#x201C;This ought to mean westwards, towards the Mediterranean, but it seems quite clear that at this point the boundary of Benjamin turned eastwards; and the sea is presumably the Dead Sea, its eastward limit.&#x201D;"}
