(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001109/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 8:1-10</a>) Though various sites have been suggested for Dalmanutha, the name is not referred to in other Biblical or non-Biblical sources, so its exact location remains unknown. Some scholars feel Dalmanutha may be a scribal alteration, since the parallel narrative at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001109/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 15:29-39</a> has &#x201C;Magadan&#x201D; and certain ancient manuscripts of Mark&#x2019;s account also use &#x201C;Magadan&#x201D; or &#x201C;Magdala&#x201D; instead of Dalmanutha. However, since the best Greek manuscripts do have Dalmanutha, instead of considering the term to be a textual error, it seems best to preserve the reading Dalmanutha. Possibly Dalmanutha was simply another name for Magadan, or it may have been a nearby area the name of which, though little used or not widely known, has nevertheless been preserved for us in Mark&#x2019;s Gospel."}
