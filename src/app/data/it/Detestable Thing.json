Their usage in the Bible indicates strong aversion to or rejection of things or persons on the basis of their violating certain principles or not meeting definite standards held by the one so viewing them.Thus at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001161/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 43:32</a> we read that it was &#x201C;a detestable thing&#x201D; (&#x201C;abomination,&#x201D; <em>KJ; </em>&#x201C;abhorrent,&#x201D; <em>AT</em>) for Egyptians to eat with Hebrews, and at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001161/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 46:34</a> that &#x201C;every herder of sheep is a detestable thing [&#x201C;abomination,&#x201D; <em>KJ; </em>&#x201C;abhorrent,&#x201D; <em>AT</em>] to Egypt.&#x201D; According to G.&#xA0;Rawlinson, this aversion was based on the Egyptian contempt for foreigners in general and for herdsmen in particular. Again, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001161/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Exodus 8:25-27</a>, we find Moses, fully aware of the Egyptians&#x2019; adoration of certain animals (and particularly of the cow) as sacred, insisting that Pharaoh allow the Israelites to withdraw into the wilderness to make their sacrifices because these would be &#x201C;a thing detestable to the Egyptians.&#x201D; (<em>Egypt and Babylon From Sacred and Profane Sources, </em>1885, p.&#xA0;182) Such Egyptian standards, of course, were not divinely set or approved by Jehovah God.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001161/0\">ABHORRENT THING</a>.God&#x2019;s own declared standards, principles, and requirements are shown to be the proper basis for detestation.

It also shows why there is a marked contrast or open conflict between the position or mental attitude of those who follow God&#x2019;s Word and those ignoring or rejecting it in preference to their own standards or those of others.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001161/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 29:27</a>.<span id=\"page618\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"618\" data-before-text=\"618\"></span><strong>Among the Canaanites. </strong>Before Israel&#x2019;s entry into Canaan, Jehovah made plain to them the practices and customs of the peoples of Canaan that were detestable to him, and these they were to detest.
