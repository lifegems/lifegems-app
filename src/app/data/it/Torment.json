It basically meant &#x201C;test by the proving stone [<em>ba&#x2B9;sa&#xB7;nos</em>]&#x201D; and, by extension, &#x201C;examine or question by applying torture.&#x201D; Lexicographers point out that in the Christian Greek Scriptures it is used with the sense of &#x2018;vexing with grievous pains; being harassed, distressed.&#x2019;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 8:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 8:28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 12:2</a>.The Bible used <em>ba&#xB7;sa&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;zo </em>in a number of instances. For example, a manservant afflicted with paralysis was &#x201C;terribly tormented&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>) or &#x201C;racked with pain&#x201D; (<em>NE</em>) by it. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 8:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> compare 4:24</a>.) Also, Lot &#x201C;used to torment his soul&#x201D; (<em>Ro</em>) or &#x201C;was vexed&#x201D; (<em>Mo, RS</em>) by the lawless deeds of the people of Sodom. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 2:8</a>) The word is even used in regard to the difficult progress of a boat.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 14:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 6:48</a>.The Greek noun <em>ba&#xB7;sa&#xB7;ni&#xB7;stes&#x2B9; </em>occurring at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 18:34</a> is rendered &#x201C;jailers&#x201D; in some translations (<em>AT, Fn, NW; </em>compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 18:30</a>) and &#x201C;tormentors&#x201D; or &#x201C;torturers&#x201D; in others. (<em>AS, KJ, JB</em>) Torture was sometimes used in prisons to obtain information (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 22:24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 29</a>, which shows that this was done, although <em>ba&#xB7;sa&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;zo </em>is not used here), so <em>ba&#xB7;sa&#xB7;ni&#xB7;stes&#x2B9; </em>came to be applied to jailers. Regarding its use at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 18:34</a>, <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia </em>observed: &#x201C;Probably the imprisonment itself was regarded as &#x2018;torment&#x2019; (as it doubtless was), and the &#x2018;tormentors&#x2019; need mean nothing more than jailers.&#x201D; (Edited by J.&#xA0;Orr, 1960, Vol.&#xA0;V, p.&#xA0;2999) Thus, the mentioning in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 20:10</a> of ones who will be &#x201C;tormented day and night forever and ever&#x201D; evidently indicates that they will be in a condition of restraint. That a condition of restraint can be spoken of as &#x201C;torment&#x201D; is indicated by the parallel accounts at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 8:29</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 8:31</a>.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/0\">LAKE OF FIRE</a>.Some commentators have pointed to Biblical instances of the word &#x201C;torment&#x201D; to support the teaching of eternal suffering in fire. However, as just indicated, there is Scriptural reason to believe that <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 20:10</a> does not have that sense. In fact, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">verse 14</a> shows that &#x201C;the lake of fire&#x201D; in which the torment occurs, actually means &#x201C;the second death.&#x201D; And though Jesus spoke of a certain rich man as &#x201C;existing in torments&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 16:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;28</a>), as the article <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/1\">LAZARUS</a> (No.&#xA0;2) shows, Jesus was not describing the literal experience of a real person but, rather, was setting forth an illustration. Revelation provides a number of other instances where &#x201C;torment&#x201D; clearly has an illustrative or symbolic sense, as is evident from context.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Re 9:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/14/2\" data-bid=\"15-3\" class=\"b\"> 18:7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004454/14/3\" data-bid=\"15-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;10</a>."}
