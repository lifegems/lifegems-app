According to an emendation, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004692/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 27:8</a> mentions &#x201C;skilled [wise] men of Zemer&#x201D; (<em>RS; BE</em>), suggested by some as the city of the Zemarites and tentatively identified with Tell Kazel, about 35&#xA0;km (22&#xA0;mi) NE of Tripoli. However, here the Hebrew text reads: &#x201C;Your skilled ones [men], O&#xA0;Tyre.&#x201D; (<em>AT; RS, </em>ftn) Pointing to another location, others would link the Zemarites with Sumra, a seacoast town between Tripoli and Arvad."}
