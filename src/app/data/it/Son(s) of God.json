Others referred to as &#x201C;son(s) of God&#x201D; include intelligent spirit creatures produced by God, the man Adam before he sinned, and humans with whom God has dealt on the basis of covenant relationship.<strong>&#x201C;Sons of the True God.&#x201D; </strong>The first mention of &#x201C;sons of the true God&#x201D; is at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 6:2-4</a>. There such sons are spoken of as &#x2018;beginning to notice the daughters of men, that they were good-looking; and they went taking wives for themselves, namely, all whom they chose,&#x2019; this prior to the global Flood.Many commentators hold that these &#x2018;sons of God&#x2019; were themselves human, being in reality men of the line of Seth. They base their argument on the fact that Seth&#x2019;s line was that through which godly Noah came, whereas the other lines from Adam, that of Cain and those of any other sons born to Adam (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 5:3,&#xA0;4</a>), were destroyed at the Flood. So, they say that the taking as wives &#x201C;the daughters of men&#x201D; by &#x201C;the sons of the true God&#x201D; means that Sethites began to marry into the line of wicked Cain.There is, however, nothing to show that God made any such distinction between family lines at this point. Corroborating Scriptural evidence is lacking to support the view that intermarriage between the lines of Seth and Cain is what is here meant, or that such marriages were responsible for the birth of &#x201C;mighty ones&#x201D; as mentioned in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">verse 4</a>. It is true that the expression &#x201C;sons of men [or &#x201C;of mankind&#x201D;]&#x201D; (which those favoring the earlier mentioned view would contrast with the expression &#x2018;sons of God&#x2019;) is frequently used in an unfavorable sense, but this is not consistently so.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 4:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 57:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Pr 8:22,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> 30, 31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/3/4\" data-bid=\"4-5\" class=\"b\"> Jer 32:18, 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/3/5\" data-bid=\"4-6\" class=\"b\"> Da 10:16</a>.<strong><em>Angelic sons of God. </em></strong>On the other hand, there is an explanation that finds corroborating evidence in the Scriptures. The expression &#x201C;sons of the true God&#x201D; next occurs at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:6</a>, and here the reference is obviously to spirit sons of God <span id=\"page997\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"997\" data-before-text=\"997\"></span>assembled in God&#x2019;s presence, among whom Satan, who had been &#x201C;roving about in the earth,&#x201D; also appeared. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> see also 2:1,&#xA0;2</a>.) Again at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 38:4-7</a> &#x201C;the sons of God&#x201D; who &#x2018;shouted in applause&#x2019; when God &#x2018;laid the cornerstone&#x2019; of the earth clearly were angelic sons and not humans descended from Adam (as yet not even created). So, too, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 89:6</a> &#x201C;the sons of God&#x201D; are definitely heavenly creatures, not earthlings.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/0\">GOD</a> (Hebrew Terms).The identification of &#x201C;the sons of the true God&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 6:2-4</a> with angelic creatures is objected to by those holding the previously mentioned view because they say the context relates entirely to <em>human </em>wickedness. This objection is not valid, however, since the wrongful interjection of spirit creatures in human affairs most certainly could contribute to or accelerate the growth of human wickedness. Wicked spirit creatures during Jesus&#x2019; time on earth, though not then materializing in visible form, were responsible for wrong human conduct of an extreme nature. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/1\">DEMON</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/2\">DEMON POSSESSION</a>.) The mention of a mixing into human affairs by angelic sons of God could reasonably appear in the Genesis account precisely because of its explaining to a considerable degree the gravity of the situation that had developed on earth prior to the Flood.Supporting this are the apostle Peter&#x2019;s references to &#x201C;the spirits in prison, who had once been disobedient when the patience of God was waiting in Noah&#x2019;s days&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:19,&#xA0;20</a>), and to &#x201C;the angels that sinned,&#x201D; mentioned in connection with the &#x201C;ancient world&#x201D; of Noah&#x2019;s time (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 2:4,&#xA0;5</a>), as well as Jude&#x2019;s statement concerning &#x201C;the angels that did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Jude&#xA0;6</a>) If it is denied that &#x201C;the sons of the true God&#x201D; of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 6:2-4</a> were spirit creatures, then these statements by the Christian writers become enigmatic, with nothing to explain the manner in which this angelic disobedience took place, or its actual relation to Noah&#x2019;s time.Angels definitely did materialize human bodies on occasion, even eating and drinking with men. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 18:1-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:1-3</a>) Jesus&#x2019; statement concerning resurrected men and women not marrying or being given in marriage but being like the &#x201C;angels in heaven&#x201D; shows that marriages between such heavenly creatures do not exist, no male and female distinction being indicated among them. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 22:30</a>) But this does not say that such angelic creatures could not materialize human forms and enter marriage relations with human women. It should be noted that Jude&#x2019;s reference to angels as not keeping their original position and to them as forsaking their &#x201C;proper dwelling place&#x201D; (certainly here referring to an abandoning of the spirit realm) is immediately followed by the statement: &#x201C;So too Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, after they <em>in the same manner as the foregoing ones </em>had committed fornication excessively and <em>gone out after flesh for unnatural use, </em>are placed before us as a warning example.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Jude&#xA0;6,&#xA0;7</a>) Thus, the combined weight of the Scriptural evidence points to angelic deviation, the performance of acts contrary to their spirit nature, occurring in the days of Noah. There seems to be no valid reason, then, for doubting that the &#x2018;sons of God&#x2019; of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 6:2-4</a> were angelic sons.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/3\">NEPHILIM</a>.<strong>First Human Son and His Descendants. </strong>Adam was the first human &#x201C;son of God&#x201D; by virtue of his creation by God. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 3:38</a>) When he was condemned to death as a willful sinner and was evicted from God&#x2019;s sanctuary in Eden, he was, in effect, disowned by God and lost his filial relationship with his heavenly Father.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:17-24</a>.Those descended from him have been born with inherited sinful tendencies. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/4\">SIN, I</a>.) Since they were born of one rejected by God, Adam&#x2019;s descendants could not claim the relationship of being a son of God simply on the basis of birth. This is demonstrated by the apostle John&#x2019;s words at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:12,&#xA0;13</a>. He shows that those who received Christ Jesus, exercising faith in his name, were given &#x201C;authority to become God&#x2019;s children, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. [being] born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man&#x2019;s will, but from God.&#x201D; Sonship in relation to God, therefore, is not viewed as something automatically received by all of Adam&#x2019;s descendants at birth. This and other texts show that, since Adam&#x2019;s fall into sin, it has required some special recognition by God for men to be designated as his &#x201C;sons.&#x201D; This is illustrated in his dealings with Israel.<strong>&#x201C;Israel Is My Son.&#x201D; </strong>To Pharaoh, who considered himself a god and a son of the Egyptian god Ra, Jehovah spoke of Israel as &#x201C;my son, my firstborn,&#x201D; and called on the Egyptian ruler to &#x201C;send my son away that he may serve me.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 4:22,&#xA0;23</a>) Thus the entire nation of Israel was viewed by God as his &#x201C;son&#x201D; because of being his chosen people, a &#x201C;special property, out of all the peoples.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">De 14:1,&#xA0;2</a>) Not only because Jehovah is the Source of all life but more specifically because God had, in harmony with the Abrahamic covenant, produced this people, he is called their &#x201C;Creator,&#x201D; their &#x201C;Former,&#x201D; and their &#x201C;Father,&#x201D; the one <span id=\"page998\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"998\" data-before-text=\"998\"></span>by whose name they were called.

Since the context in the psalm shows that God is speaking, not to a baby, but to a grown man, in saying, &#x201C;You are my son; I, today, I have become your father,&#x201D; it follows that David&#x2019;s entry into such sonship resulted from God&#x2019;s special selection of him for the kingship and from God&#x2019;s fatherly dealings with him.

This gives us the sense of only-begotten. The ref. is to the only child of one&#x2019;s parents, primarily in relation to them. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. But the word can also be used more generally without ref. to derivation in the sense of &#x2018;unique,&#x2019; &#x2018;unparalleled,&#x2019; &#x2018;incomparable,&#x2019; though one should not confuse the refs. to class or species and to manner.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Translator and editor, G.&#xA0;Bromiley, 1969, Vol.&#xA0;IV, p.&#xA0;738.As to the use of the term in the Christian Greek Scriptures or &#x201C;New Testament,&#x201D; this latter work (pp.&#xA0;739-741) says: &#x201C;It means &#x2018;only-begotten.&#x2019; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.

As can be seen, this text did not refer to persons as being called &#x201C;God,&#x201D; but &#x201C;gods&#x201D; and &#x201C;sons of the Most High.&#x201D;According to the context, those whom Jehovah called &#x201C;gods&#x201D; and &#x201C;sons of the Most High&#x201D; in this psalm were Israelite judges who had been practicing injustice, requiring that Jehovah himself now judge &#x2018;in the middle of such gods.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/118/0\" data-bid=\"119-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 82:1-6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/118/1\" data-bid=\"119-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;8</a>) Since Jehovah applied these terms to those men, Jesus was certainly guilty of no blasphemy in saying, &#x201C;I am God&#x2019;s Son.&#x201D; Whereas the works of those judicial &#x201C;gods&#x201D; belied their being &#x201C;sons of the Most High,&#x201D; Jesus&#x2019; works consistently proved him to be in union, in harmonious accord and relationship, with his Father.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/119/0\" data-bid=\"120-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 10:34-38</a>."}
