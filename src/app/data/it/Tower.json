The history of tower building goes back to the time shortly after the Flood when men on the Plains of Shinar declared: &#x201C;Come on! Let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:2-4</a>) That tower is thought to have been styled along the oblique pyramid lines of the religious ziggurats discovered in that part of the earth.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/0\">BABEL</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/1\">ARCHAEOLOGY</a> (Babylonia).Simple towers were built in vineyards as vantage points for watchmen in guarding the vines against thieves and animals.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 5:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 21:33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Mr 12:1</a>.For military defense, towers were built into the walls of cities, usually with more prominent ones at the corners and flanking the gates.

These served as elevated firing positions for archers or throwers.

This Phasael tower was one of the three built by Herod the Great for the protection of his new palace erected near the site of the ancient Corner Gate on the W side of the city.The <em>Tower in Siloam </em>was probably in the vicinity of the pool by that name in the SE sector of Jerusalem. Jesus mentioned that this tower collapsed, killing 18 men, an event that must have been fresh in the memory of his audience.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 13:4</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/4\">ANTONIA, TOWER OF</a>.<strong>Figurative Use. </strong>Those who look in faith and obedience to Jehovah have great security, as David sang: &#x201C;You [Jehovah] have proved to be a refuge for me, a strong tower in the face of the enemy.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004459/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 61:3</a>) Those who recognize what his name stands for, and who trust in and faithfully represent that name, have nothing to fear, for: &#x201C;The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.
