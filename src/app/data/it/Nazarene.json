The names Nazarene and Nazirite are not to be confused, for, though spelled similarly in English, they stem from altogether different Hebrew words with different meanings.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/0\">NAZIRITE</a>.It was natural and not particularly unusual to speak of Jesus as the Nazarene, since from infancy (less than three years of age) he was raised as the local carpenter&#x2019;s son in the city of Nazareth, a place about 100&#xA0;km (60&#xA0;mi) N of Jerusalem. The practice of associating persons with the places from which they came was common in those days.<span id=\"page476\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"476\" data-before-text=\"476\"></span><wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 3:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 17:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 23:25-37;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Na 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> Ac 13:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/0/5\" data-bid=\"1-6\" class=\"b\"> 21:29</a>.Frequently Jesus was referred to, in widely scattered places and by all kinds of persons, as the Nazarene.

He called this to the attention of his readers when he told how Joseph brought Mary and her child back from Egypt following Herod&#x2019;s death. &#x201C;Moreover,&#x201D; Matthew wrote, &#x201C;being given divine warning in a dream, he [Joseph] withdrew into the territory of Galilee, and came and dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: &#x2018;He will be called a Nazarene.&#x2019;&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 2:19-23</a>.Nazareth is not mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. Some suppose Matthew had reference to some lost prophetic book or some unwritten tradition, but his expression, &#x201C;spoken through the prophets,&#x201D; is used by writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures only in reference to the same canonical collection of the Hebrew Scriptures we have today. The key to understanding, apparently, lies in equating Nazarene with <em>ne&#x2B9;tser, </em>mentioned above as meaning sprout.With this in mind, it is evident that Matthew was referring to what <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003189/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah (11:1</a>) had said concerning Messiah: &#x201C;There must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jesse; and out of his roots a sprout [<em>we&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;tser</em>] will be fruitful.&#x201D; Another Hebrew word, <em>tse&#x2B9;mach, </em>also means sprout and was used by other prophets when referring to the Messiah. Matthew used the plural, saying that &#x201C;prophet<em>s&#x201D; </em>had mentioned this coming &#x201C;Sprout.&#x201D; For example, Jeremiah wrote about the &#x201C;righteous sprout&#x201D; as an offshoot of David.
