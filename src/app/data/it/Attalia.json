It became the chief port of the province of Pamphylia, serving as an outlet for the rich interior region of SW Phrygia and being the natural point of embarkation from central Asia Minor to Syria and Egypt. Although it was originally the port for the nearby city of Perga, which lies about 13&#xA0;km (8&#xA0;mi) inland, Attalia had displaced that city in importance in apostolic times."}
