Also, &#x201C;the key of the house of David&#x201D; was to be placed upon Eliakim&#x2019;s shoulder, suggesting that he would be entrusted with the oversight of the king&#x2019;s chambers and the authority to decide who might be accepted into the service of the king.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001295/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 22:15-24</a>.Acting in this official capacity, Eliakim, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, apparently the recorder, came out to speak with Rabshakeh, who had come to Jerusalem with a heavy military force to demand the surrender of the city. Then, with garments ripped apart, the three of them reported the words of Sennacherib&#x2019;s spokesmen to King Hezekiah, who, in turn, proceeded to send Eliakim, Shebna, and the older men of the priests to Isaiah to make inquiry of Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001295/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 36:11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001295/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001295/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 37:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001295/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 18:17, 18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001295/1/4\" data-bid=\"2-5\" class=\"b\"> 26,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001295/1/5\" data-bid=\"2-6\" class=\"b\"> 36, 37;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001295/1/6\" data-bid=\"2-7\" class=\"b\"> 19:1,&#xA0;2</a>.<strong>2. </strong>King of Judah (628-618&#xA0;B.C.E.) whom Pharaoh Nechoh placed upon the throne, changing his name to Jehoiakim.
