In connection with the installation of the priesthood, the right leg of &#x201C;the ram of the installation&#x201D; constituted a part of the &#x201C;wave offering.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Le 8:22,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 25-27</a>) In certain sacrifices, the right hind leg, evidently the choice upper part of it, was also given as a sacred portion to the officiating priest. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Le 7:32-34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 14,&#xA0;15</a>) The front leg, the &#x201C;shoulder&#x201D; or &#x201C;shoulder blade&#x201D; (literally, &#x201C;arm&#x201D;), is also mentioned as a portion for the priests, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Numbers 6:19</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>.Insects having &#x201C;leaper legs&#x201D; (Heb., <em>kera&#xB7;&#x2BD;a&#x2B9;yim</em>) were the only winged swarming creatures designated by the Law as clean for food. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Le 11:21</a>) Elsewhere, the same Hebrew term refers to the &#x201C;shanks&#x201D; of animals.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/0\">SHANK</a>.Jehovah prophetically told Babylon: &#x201C;Strip off the flowing skirt. Uncover the leg. Cross over the rivers.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 47:1,&#xA0;2</a>) Instead of being a pampered queen who is served, she figuratively had to uncover her legs to the hip to wade barefoot as a captive across the rivers through which her conquerors would drag her.Legs were also used figuratively to represent mightiness or human swiftness and power. At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 147:10</a> we read: &#x201C;Not in the mightiness of the horse does [Jehovah] take delight, nor in the legs of the man does he find pleasure.&#x201D; At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 26:7</a> lame legs are referred to as a symbol of uselessness or incapacity.It appears to have been a Roman custom to perform a coup de grace by breaking the legs of criminals condemned to die on the stake in order to shorten their miseries. The soldiers, at the Jews&#x2019; request, broke the legs of the men impaled on stakes alongside Jesus Christ but, finding Jesus already dead, did not break his legs. Consequently, the prophecy at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 34:20</a> was fulfilled.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:31-36</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 12:46;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002712/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> Nu 9:12</a>."}
