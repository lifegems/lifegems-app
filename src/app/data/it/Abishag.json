(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000049/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:17-23</a>) She was &#x201C;beautiful in the extreme&#x201D; and was chosen by David&#x2019;s servants to become the nurse and companion of the king during his final days.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000049/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 1:1-4</a>.David was now about 70 years of age (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000049/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 5:4,&#xA0;5</a>), and as a result of debilitation he had little body heat. Abishag waited on him during the day, doubtless brightening the surroundings with her youthful freshness and beauty, and at night she &#x2018;lay in the king&#x2019;s bosom&#x2019; to give him warmth, but &#x201C;the king himself had no intercourse with her.&#x201D; Nevertheless, the attitude later manifested by Solomon regarding her indicates that Abishag was viewed as being in the position of wife or concubine of David. As such, by a rule in the ancient East, she would become the property of David&#x2019;s heir at the time of his death.The account concerning Abishag directly precedes the account of the attempt at gaining the crown by the one who was probably David&#x2019;s oldest surviving son, Adonijah, and would seem to be so placed to give understanding to Adonijah&#x2019;s subsequent action during Solomon&#x2019;s reign. Solomon, after ascending the throne, had placed Adonijah on conditional pardon. Now Adonijah persuaded Solomon&#x2019;s mother, Bath-sheba, to ask Solomon to give him Abishag as his wife. Solomon, convinced that Adonijah&#x2019;s request was not due alone to Abishag&#x2019;s beauty but, rather, indicated a subtle effort to strengthen Adonijah&#x2019;s claim to the throne, reacted angrily, revoked Adonijah&#x2019;s pardon, and ordered his death.
