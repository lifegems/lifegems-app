At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002825/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, &#x201C;You, too, O&#xA0;Madmen, should keep silent,&#x201D; translates the Hebrew phrase <em>gam-madh&#xB7;men&#x2B9; tid&#xB7;dom&#x2B9;mi. </em>Many scholars believe that the initial <em>m </em>in <em>madh&#xB7;men&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;Madmen&#x201D;) was inadvertently repeated from the previous word (<em>gam</em>). Without the initial <em>m, </em>the consonants of Madmen correspond to those of Dimon, and therefore, Madmen is often considered to be the same as Dimon (possibly, Dimna, about 10&#xA0;km [6&#xA0;mi] N of Karak). However, perhaps Madmen does not designate an actual location, since the renderings of the Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>Syriac <em>Peshitta, </em>and Latin <em>Vulgate </em>suggest that the ancient Hebrew text read, &#x2018;Yes, you [Moab] shall be utterly brought to silence.&#x2019;"}
