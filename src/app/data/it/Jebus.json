(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002352/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:2</a>) Mention was made of Urusalim (Jerusalem) in the Amarna Tablets found in Egypt. And in the books of Joshua, Judges, and First Samuel, where events prior to the conquest of the city by David are mentioned, the site is often called Jerusalem.

It is also generally agreed that &#x201C;Jebus&#x201D; was not a contraction of Jerusalem but, rather, a contraction of Jebusites, the name of the occupants of the site for a time. After David&#x2019;s capture of this stronghold of Zion and the establishment of his royal residence there, it was sometimes referred to as the &#x201C;City of David.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002352/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 5:7</a>.The Jebusites, who occupied this city and the surrounding area, were descendants of Ham and Canaan.

Once again the Jebusites rallied to resist, this time under the banner of Jabin, the king of Hazor, and again Israel defeated them, with Jehovah&#x2019;s help.
