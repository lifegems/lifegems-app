A mob of jealous Jews set about to take Paul and Silas from Jason&#x2019;s house, but, not finding them there, they took Jason instead and made him the principal defendant in charges of sedition against Caesar. Jason and the others with him were released after giving &#x201C;sufficient security,&#x201D; perhaps in the form of bail.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002340/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 17:5-10</a>.In Paul&#x2019;s letter to the Romans, written from Corinth on his next trip through Macedonia and Greece, Jason is one whose greetings are included. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002340/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 16:21</a>) If he is the same person as the Jason in Thessalonica, he apparently had come to Corinth, possibly with Paul. He is called a &#x2018;relative&#x2019; of Paul, which can mean that he was a fellow countryman, though the primary meaning of the Greek word is &#x201C;blood relative of the same generation.&#x201D; If a close fleshly relative of Paul, he was naturally the one with whom Paul would stay in Thessalonica."}
