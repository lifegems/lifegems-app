To the NW of Lycia lay Caria; to the N, Phrygia and Pisidia; and to the NE, Pamphylia. The mountains in the territory of ancient Lycia are spurs of the Taurus Range. Particularly in the eastern half of the region, they rise almost directly from the coast. The river valleys, chief of which is that of the Xanthus (modern Koca), are fertile. Vegetation thrives on the hills, and the mountain slopes provide pasture for sheep.Two Lycian cities, Patara and Myra, are specifically mentioned in connection with the apostle Paul&#x2019;s travels. But there is no record of his doing any preaching there.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002796/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 21:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002796/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 27:5</a>."}
