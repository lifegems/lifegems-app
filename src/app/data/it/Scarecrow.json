Jeremiah likened the idols of the nations to &#x201C;a scarecrow [Heb., <em>to&#x2B9;mer</em>] of a cucumber field.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003851/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 10:5</a>) The word <em>to&#x2B9;mer </em>is elsewhere rendered &#x201C;palm tree.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003851/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:5</a>) Truly the idols of the nations amounted to no more than a scarecrow, a falsity.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>AT, Mo, NE, NW, RS.</em>"}
