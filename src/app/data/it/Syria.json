The region is called Aram in the Hebrew Scriptures. These boundaries are only general, since Syrian influence and domination within this area were rather fluid and unstable most of the time.<strong>In Patriarchal Times. </strong>Of patriarchal times our only Biblical records of the Syrians concern events around Haran involving the lives of Rebekah&#x2019;s family, her father Bethuel and brother Laban both being described as Syrians, or literally, Aramaeans.
