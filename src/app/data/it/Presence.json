Hence, <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>means, literally, &#x201C;being alongside,&#x201D; that is, a &#x201C;presence.&#x201D; It is used 24 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures, frequently with regard to the presence of Christ in connection with his Messianic Kingdom.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:3</a>; see <em>NW </em>appendix, pp.&#xA0;1576, 1577.Many translations vary their renderings of this word. While translating <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>as &#x201C;presence&#x201D; in some texts, they more frequently render it as &#x201C;coming.&#x201D; This has been the basis for the expression &#x201C;second coming&#x201D; or &#x201C;second advent&#x201D; (<em>adventus </em>[&#x201C;advent&#x201D; or &#x201C;coming&#x201D;] being the Latin <em>Vulgate </em>translation of <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:3</a>) with regard to Christ Jesus. While Jesus&#x2019; presence of necessity implies his arrival at the place where he is present, the translation of <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>by &#x201C;coming&#x201D; places all the emphasis on the arrival and obscures the subsequent presence that follows the arrival. Though allowing for both &#x201C;arrival&#x201D; and &#x201C;presence&#x201D; as translations of <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a, </em>lexicographers generally acknowledge that the <em>presence </em>of the person is the principal idea conveyed by the word.<em>Vine&#x2019;s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words </em>(1981, Vol.&#xA0;1, pp.&#xA0;208, 209) states: &#x201C;PAROUSIA .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. denotes both an arrival and a consequent presence with. For instance, in a papyrus letter [written in Greek] a lady speaks of the necessity of her <em>parousia </em>in a place in order to attend to matters relating to her property there. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. When used of the return of Christ, at the Rapture of the Church, it signifies, not merely His <span id=\"page677\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"677\" data-before-text=\"677\"></span>momentary coming for His saints, but His presence with them from that moment until His revelation and manifestation to the world.&#x201D; Liddell and Scott&#x2019;s <em>Greek-English Lexicon </em>(revised by H.&#xA0;Jones, Oxford, 1968, p.&#xA0;1343) shows that <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>is used at times in secular Greek literature to refer to the <em>&#x201C;visit </em>of a royal or official personage.&#x201D;Secular Greek writings are, of course, helpful in determining the sense of this Greek term. However, even more effective is the use given the word in the Bible itself. At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Philippians 2:12</a>, for example, Paul speaks of the Philippian Christians as obeying &#x201C;not during my presence [<em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;ai</em>] only, but now much more readily during my absence [<em>a&#xB7;pou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;ai</em>].&#x201D; So, too, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Corinthians 10:10, 11</a>, after referring to those who said that &#x201C;his letters are weighty and forceful, but his presence [<em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a</em>] in person is weak and his speech contemptible,&#x201D; Paul adds, &#x201C;Let such a man take this into account, that what we are in our word by letters when absent [<em>a&#xB7;pon&#x2B9;tes</em>], such we shall also be in action when present [<em>pa&#xB7;ron&#x2B9;tes</em>].&#x201D; (Compare also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Php 1:24-27</a>.) Thus, the contrast is between presence and absence, not between an arrival (or coming) and departure.In view of this, J.&#xA0;B.&#xA0;Rotherham&#x2019;s <em>Emphasised Bible </em>states in its appendix (p.&#xA0;271): &#x201C;In this edition the word <em>parousia </em>is uniformly rendered &#x2018;presence&#x2019; (&#x2018;coming,&#x2019; as a representative of <em>this </em>word, being set aside). .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The sense of &#x2018;presence&#x2019; is so plainly [shown] by the contrast with &#x2018;absence&#x2019; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. that the question naturally arises,<wbr>&#x2014;Why not always so render it?&#x201D;That Jesus&#x2019; <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>is not simply a momentary coming followed by a rapid departure but is, rather, a presence covering a period of time is also indicated by his words recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 24:37-39</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 17:26-30</a>. Here &#x201C;the days of Noah&#x201D; are compared to &#x201C;the presence of the Son of man&#x201D; (&#x201C;the days of the Son of man,&#x201D; in Luke&#x2019;s account). Jesus, therefore, does not limit the comparison just to the coming of the Deluge as a final climax during Noah&#x2019;s days, though he shows that his own &#x201C;presence&#x201D; or &#x201C;days&#x201D; will see a similar climax. Since &#x201C;the days of Noah&#x201D; actually covered a period of years, there is basis for believing that the foretold &#x201C;presence [or &#x201C;days&#x201D;] of the Son of man&#x201D; would likewise cover a period of some years, being climaxed by the destruction of those not giving heed to the opportunity afforded them to seek deliverance.<strong>Nature of Christ&#x2019;s &#x201C;Parousia.&#x201D; </strong>A <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a, </em>or presence, can, of course, be visible, and in six occurrences of the word the reference is to the visible, human presence of men, such as Stephanas, Fortunatus, Achaicus, Titus, and Paul. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 16:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Co 7:6,&#xA0;7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 10:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\"> Php 1:26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/7/4\" data-bid=\"8-5\" class=\"b\"> 2:12</a>) That a <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>can also be invisible is indicated by Paul&#x2019;s use of the related verb form (<em>pa&#x2B9;rei&#xB7;mi</em>) when speaking of being &#x201C;present in spirit&#x201D; though absent in body. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 5:3</a>) So, too, Jewish historian Josephus, writing in Greek, refers to God&#x2019;s <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>at Mount Sinai, his invisible presence being evidenced by the thunders and lightning.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>III, 80 (v,&#xA0;2).The Scripturalness of an invisible presence is also borne out by Jehovah God&#x2019;s saying to Moses regarding the ark of the covenant in the Most Holy of the tabernacle: &#x201C;And I will present myself to you there and speak with you from above the cover.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 25:22</a>) God&#x2019;s presence was not in a visible form, since the Scriptures are clear that &#x201C;no man has seen God at any time&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;neither Moses nor the high priest who entered the Most Holy.

The heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens, themselves cannot contain you; how much less, then, this house that I have built!&#x201D; However, God&#x2019;s eyes would be opened continually toward that house and prayers that were made there would be heard by him &#x201C;at the place of [his] dwelling, in the heavens.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 8:10-13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> 27-30</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 7:45-50</a>.These accounts illustrate God&#x2019;s power to &#x2018;be present&#x2019; on earth in a spiritual (hence, invisible) way while He yet remains in heaven.

It was foretold that, in &#x201C;the last days,&#x201D; they would scoff, saying: &#x201C;Where is this promised presence of his?

We may recall that Jesus, when paralleling his presence with &#x201C;the days of Noah,&#x201D; states that in Noah&#x2019;s time the people &#x201C;took no note&#x201D; until watery destruction came upon them, and &#x201C;so the presence of the Son of man will be.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:37-39</a>.<strong><em>Events marking his presence. </em></strong>Jesus had promised to be with his followers in their meeting together (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 18:20</a>), and he also assured them that he would be &#x2018;with them&#x2019; in their discipling work &#x201C;all the days until the conclusion of the <span id=\"page679\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"679\" data-before-text=\"679\"></span>system of things.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 28:19,&#xA0;20</a>) The <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 24:3</a> and related texts, of course, must signify something beyond this. It clearly relates to a special presence, one involving and affecting all earth&#x2019;s inhabitants and inseparably connected with Jesus&#x2019; expression of full authority as King anointed by God.Among the events marking Jesus&#x2019; presence in Kingdom power are: The resurrection of those of his followers who have died, these being joint heirs with him to the heavenly Kingdom (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/45/1\" data-bid=\"46-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 8:17</a>); his gathering together and bringing into union with himself other followers who are living at the time of his presence (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Th 2:1</a>); his &#x2018;bringing to nothing&#x2019; the apostate &#x201C;man of lawlessness,&#x201D; this being accomplished &#x201C;by the manifestation [<em>e&#xB7;pi&#xB7;pha&#xB7;nei&#x2B9;ai</em>] of his [Jesus&#x2019;] presence&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">2Th 2:3-8</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/2\">MAN OF LAWLESSNESS</a>); the destruction of all those who give no heed to the opportunity for deliverance (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:37-39</a>); and, of necessity, the introduction of his Thousand Year Reign (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Re 20:1-6</a>).

The symbolic picture of the crowned rider on the white horse depicted in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 6:1, 2</a> corresponds to that of the rider of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, who is the &#x201C;King of kings and Lord of lords,&#x201D; Christ Jesus. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation chapter&#xA0;6</a> shows that when Christ rides forth as conquering King he does not immediately bring about removal of wickedness from the earth, but rather, his ride is accompanied by war that takes &#x201C;peace away from the earth,&#x201D; as well as by food scarcity and deadly plague. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Re 6:3-8</a>) This, in turn, parallels features found in Christ&#x2019;s prophecy at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/55/1\" data-bid=\"56-2\" class=\"b\"> Mark 13</a>, and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Luke&#xA0;21</a>. It therefore appears that Jesus&#x2019; prophecy found in the Gospel accounts, which clearly involves the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple (occurring in 70&#xA0;C.E.), also has an application to the time of Christ&#x2019;s presence, thereby supplying a &#x201C;sign&#x201D; that allows for determining when Jesus is present and ruling from heaven as Messianic King.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/57/1\" data-bid=\"58-2\" class=\"b\"> 32, 33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/57/2\" data-bid=\"58-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 21:29-31</a>.Other references to Christ&#x2019;s presence generally present encouragement to faithfulness and endurance until and during that time.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 2:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/58/1\" data-bid=\"59-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:12, 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/58/2\" data-bid=\"59-3\" class=\"b\"> 5:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/58/3\" data-bid=\"59-4\" class=\"b\"> Jas 5:7,&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/58/4\" data-bid=\"59-5\" class=\"b\"> 1Jo 2:28</a>.<strong>The Presence of the Day of Jehovah. </strong>In his second letter Peter exhorts his brothers to be &#x201C;awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah,&#x201D; demonstrating this by the way they live. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 3:11,&#xA0;12</a>) They must be careful to keep Jehovah&#x2019;s day of judgment constantly in mind, realizing that it is close at hand. In that &#x201C;day of Jehovah,&#x201D; the governmental &#x201C;heavens&#x201D; of this wicked world will be destroyed as by fire and the &#x201C;elements&#x201D; that go with it will not be able to hold together but will melt because of the intense heat. The present system under the control of Satan will come to its end.Since Jehovah God acts by and through his Son and appointed King, Christ Jesus (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:35</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:23,&#xA0;24</a>), it follows that there is a relationship between this promised &#x201C;presence&#x201D; of Jehovah and the &#x201C;presence&#x201D; of Christ Jesus. Logically, those who scoff at the proclamation of the one will scoff at the proclamation of the other. Again the attitude of the people prior to the Deluge is used as a corresponding example.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 3:5-7</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/63/0\" data-bid=\"64-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:37-39</a>.<strong>The Lawless One&#x2019;s Presence. </strong>At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/64/0\" data-bid=\"65-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Thessalonians 2:9-12</a> the apostle describes &#x201C;the lawless one&#x2019;s presence&#x201D; as being &#x201C;according to the operation of Satan with every powerful work and lying signs and portents and with every unrighteous deception.&#x201D; This, too, illustrates the point that <em>pa&#xB7;rou&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a </em>means more than a momentary coming, or arrival, for a period of time of some length is required for the effecting of all these works, signs, portents, and this deception."}
