Its boundaries appear to have fluctuated, but basically Mysia was bounded from W to N by the Aegean Sea, the Hellespont (Dardanelles) and Propontis (Sea of Marmara). Bithynia lay to the E and Lydia to the S. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003145/0\">ASIA</a>.) While on his second missionary journey, Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy, endeavored to go to Bithynia, but &#x201C;the spirit of Jesus did not permit them. So they passed Mysia by and came down to Troas.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003145/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 15:40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003145/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:1-3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003145/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 7,&#xA0;8</a>) Since the seaport of Troas was in Mysia, evidently this means that Paul and his companions, although going through Mysia, omitted it as a field of missionary activity. Other cities of Mysia were Adramyttium (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003145/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 27:2</a>), Assos (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003145/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:13,&#xA0;14</a>), and Pergamum.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003145/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Re 1:11</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003145/1\">TROAS</a>."}
