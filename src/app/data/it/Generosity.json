For you should generously open your hand to him .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. You should by all means give to him, and your heart should not be stingy in your giving to him .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.

Such gestures of generosity, Paul declared, resulted in &#x201C;an expression of thanks to God.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001649/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 9:8-13</a>.<span id=\"page919\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"919\" data-before-text=\"919\"></span>Paul, encouraging this same godly generosity, wrote <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001649/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">the Romans (12:8</a>): &#x201C;He that distributes, let him do it with liberality.&#x201D; To <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001649/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">the Hebrews (13:16</a>) he wrote: &#x201C;Moreover, do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.&#x201D; The congregations in Macedonia were outstanding examples of generous giving. The fact that they had even joyfully gone &#x201C;beyond their actual ability,&#x201D; contributing out of their poverty, made &#x201C;the riches of their generosity abound.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001649/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 8:1-4</a>.Let it be noted that these scriptures on generosity and liberality are not in conflict or out of balance with others that condemn ingrates, sluggards, and lazy persons. For example, the lazy one who will not plow in cold weather deserves nothing when begging in harvesttime; he that refuses to work is not entitled to the generosity of others.
