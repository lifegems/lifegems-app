It is still called Tiberias (Teverya) and is situated about 25&#xA0;km (15&#xA0;mi) ENE of Nazareth, on a comparatively narrow strip along the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, 210&#xA0;m (690&#xA0;ft) below the level of the Mediterranean. Tiberias was about 15&#xA0;km (9.5&#xA0;mi) around the sea from Capernaum and 9&#xA0;km (5.5&#xA0;mi) above where the Jordan leaves that body of water. Here Herod as the tetrarch made his residence. Nearby, to the S of the city, were famous warm springs.
