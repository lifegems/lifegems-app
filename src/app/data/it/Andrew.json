He then found and informed his brother Simon and led him to Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:36-41</a>) The two brothers returned to their fishing business, but between six months and a year later, after the arrest of John the Baptizer, they, along with James and John, were invited by Jesus to become &#x201C;fishers of men.&#x201D; They immediately abandoned their nets and began accompanying Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:18-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 1:14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 16-20</a>) In time these four became apostles, and it is notable that Andrew is always listed as among the first four in all the apostolic lists.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 3:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 6:14</a>.Andrew thereafter receives but brief mention. He and Philip discuss with Jesus the problem of feeding a crowd of about 5,000 men, and Andrew offers a suggestion that he himself considers of little practical value about some available food. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 6:8,&#xA0;9</a>) At the time of the last Passover festival that they celebrated, Philip comes to Andrew for advice about a request of some Greeks to see Jesus, and the two then approach Jesus on the matter. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000273/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 12:20-22</a>) He is among the four on the Mount of Olives who ask Jesus for the sign that would mark the conclusion of the existing system of things.
