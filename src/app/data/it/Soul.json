This fact has steadily gained wider acknowledgment. Back in 1897, in the <em>Journal of Biblical Literature </em>(Vol.&#xA0;XVI, p.&#xA0;30), Professor C.&#xA0;A.&#xA0;Briggs, as a result of detailed analysis of the use of <em>ne&#x2B9;phesh, </em>observed: &#x201C;Soul in English usage at the present time conveys usually a very different meaning from &#x5E0;&#x5E4;&#x5E9; [<em>ne&#x2B9;phesh</em>] in Hebrew, and it is easy for the incautious reader to misinterpret.&#x201D;More recently, when The Jewish Publication Society of America issued a new translation of the Torah, or first five books of the Bible, the editor-in-chief, H.&#xA0;M.&#xA0;Orlinsky of Hebrew Union College, stated that the word &#x201C;soul&#x201D; had been virtually eliminated from this translation because, &#x201C;the Hebrew word in question here is &#x2018;Nefesh.&#x2019;&#x201D; He added: &#x201C;Other translators have interpreted it to mean &#x2018;soul,&#x2019; which is completely inaccurate. The Bible does not say we have a soul. &#x2018;Nefesh&#x2019; is the person himself, his need for food, the very blood in his veins, his being.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The New York Times, </em>October&#xA0;12, 1962.<strong><em>What is the origin of the teaching that the human soul is invisible and immortal?</em></strong>The difficulty lies in the fact that the meanings popularly attached to the English word &#x201C;soul&#x201D; stem primarily, not from the Hebrew or Christian Greek Scriptures, but from ancient Greek philosophy, actually pagan religious thought. Greek philosopher Plato, for example, quotes Socrates as saying: &#x201C;The soul, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. if it departs pure, dragging with it nothing of the body, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. goes away into that which is like itself, into the invisible, divine, immortal, and wise, and when it arrives there it is happy, freed from error and folly and fear .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. and all the other human ills, and .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. lives in truth through all after time with the gods.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Phaedo, </em>80, D, E; 81, A.In direct contrast with the Greek teaching of the <em>psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9; </em>(soul) as being immaterial, intangible, invisible, and immortal, the Scriptures show that both <em>psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9; </em>and <em>ne&#x2B9;phesh, </em>as used with reference to earthly creatures, refer to that which is material, tangible, visible, and mortal.The <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>says: <em>&#x201C;Nepes </em>[<em>ne&#x2B9;phesh</em>] is a term of far greater extension than our &#x2018;soul,&#x2019; signifying life (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21.23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Dt 19.21</a>) and its various vital manifestations: breathing (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Gn 35.18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Jb&#xA0;41.13[21</a>]), blood [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Gn 9.4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Dt 12.23; </a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\">Ps 140(141).8</a>], desire (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2 Sm 3.21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Prv 23.2</a>).

Of Plato, to whose philosophy the common ideas about the English &#x201C;soul&#x201D; may be attributed (as is generally acknowledged), it is stated: &#x201C;While he sometimes speaks of one of [the alleged] three parts of the soul, the &#x2018;intelligible,&#x2019; as necessarily immortal, while the other two parts are mortal, he also speaks as if there were two souls in one body, one immortal and divine, the other mortal.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Evangelical Quarterly, </em>London, 1931, Vol.&#xA0;III, p.&#xA0;121, &#x201C;Thoughts on the Tripartite Theory of Human Nature,&#x201D; by A.&#xA0;McCaig.In view of such inconsistency in non-Biblical writings, it is essential to let the Scriptures speak for themselves, showing what the inspired writers meant by their use of the term <em>psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9;, </em>as well as by <em>ne&#x2B9;phesh. Ne&#x2B9;phesh </em>occurs 754 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Scriptures, while <em>psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9; </em>appears by itself 102 times in the Westcott and Hort text of the Christian Greek Scriptures, giving a total of 856 occurrences. (See <em>NW </em>appendix, p.&#xA0;1573.) This frequency of occurrence makes possible a clear concept of the sense that these terms conveyed to the minds of the inspired Bible writers and the sense their writings should convey to our mind. An examination shows that, while the sense of these terms is broad, with different shades of meaning, among the Bible writers there was no inconsistency, confusion, or disharmony as to man&#x2019;s nature, as existed among the Grecian philosophers of the so-called Classical Period.<strong>Earth&#x2019;s First Souls. </strong>The initial occurrences of <em>ne&#x2B9;phesh </em>are found at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 1:20-23</a>.

Notably, the Christian Greek Scriptures coincide in applying the Greek <em>psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9; </em>to animals, as at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 8:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:3</a>, where it is used of creatures in the sea.Thus, the Scriptures clearly show that <em>ne&#x2B9;phesh </em>and <em>psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9; </em>are used to designate the animal creation lower than man. The same terms apply to man.<strong>The Human Soul. </strong>Precisely the same Hebrew phrase used of the animal creation, namely, <em>ne&#x2B9;phesh chai&#xB7;yah&#x2B9; </em>(living soul), is applied to Adam, when, after God formed man out of dust from the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life, &#x201C;the man came to be a living soul.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:7</a>) Man was distinct from the animal creation, but that distinction was not because he was a <em>ne&#x2B9;phesh </em>(soul) and they were not. Rather, the record shows that it was because man alone was created &#x201C;in God&#x2019;s image.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:26,&#xA0;27</a>) He was created with moral qualities like those of God, with power and wisdom far superior to the animals; hence he could have in subjection all the lower forms of creature life. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:26,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;28</a>) Man&#x2019;s organism was more complex, as well as more versatile, than that of the animals. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:39</a>.) Likewise, Adam had, but lost, the prospect of eternal life; this is never stated with regard to the creatures lower than man.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:15-17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:22-24</a>.It is true that the account says that &#x2018;God proceeded to blow into the man&#x2019;s nostrils the breath [form of <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;</em>] of life,&#x2019; whereas this is not stated in the account of the animal creation. Clearly, however, the account of the creation of man is much more detailed than that of the creation of animals. Moreover, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 7:21-23</a>, in describing the Flood&#x2019;s destruction of &#x201C;all flesh&#x201D; outside the ark, lists the animal creatures along with mankind and says: &#x201C;Everything in which the breath [form of <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;</em>] of the force of life was active in its nostrils, namely, all that were on the dry ground, died.&#x201D; Obviously, the breath of life of the animal creatures also originally came from the Creator, Jehovah God.So, too, the &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; (Heb., <em>ru&#x2B9;ach; </em>Gr., <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma</em>), or life-force, of man is not distinct from the life-force in animals, as is shown by <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ecclesiastes 3:19-21</a>, which states that &#x201C;they all have but one spirit [<em>weru&#x2B9;ach</em>].&#x201D;<strong>Soul<wbr>&#x2014;A Living Creature. </strong>As stated, man &#x201C;came to be a living soul&#x201D;; hence man <em>was </em>a soul, he did not <em>have </em>a soul as something immaterial, <span id=\"page1006\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1006\" data-before-text=\"1006\"></span>invisible, and intangible residing inside him. The apostle Paul shows that the Christian teaching did not differ from the earlier Hebrew teaching, for he quotes <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 2:7</a> in saying: &#x201C;It is even so written: &#x2018;The first man Adam became a living soul [<em>psy&#xB7;khen&#x2B9; zo&#x2B9;san</em>].&#x2019; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The first man is out of the earth and made of dust.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:45-47</a>.The Genesis account shows that a living soul results from the combination of the earthly body with the breath of life.

To illustrate the probable meaning: A person might sell himself (his soul) into slavery to another, thereby becoming the possession of his owner and master. Yet he might not serve his master wholeheartedly, with full motivation and desire to please him, and thus he might not use his full strength or his full mental capacity to advance his master&#x2019;s interests.

Hence these other facets are evidently mentioned to focus attention on them so that we do not fail to remember and consider them in our service to God, to whom we belong, and to his Son, whose life was the ransom price that bought us. &#x201C;Whole-souled&#x201D; service to God involves the entire person, no bodily part, function, capacity, or desire being left out.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/78/0\" data-bid=\"79-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:28-30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/78/1\" data-bid=\"79-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 21:34-36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/78/2\" data-bid=\"79-3\" class=\"b\"> Eph 6:6-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/78/3\" data-bid=\"79-4\" class=\"b\"> Php 3:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004192/78/4\" data-bid=\"79-5\" class=\"b\"> Col 3:23,&#xA0;24</a>.<strong>Soul and Spirit Are Distinct. </strong>The &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; (Heb., <em>ru&#x2B9;ach; </em>Gr., <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma</em>) should not be confused with the &#x201C;soul&#x201D; (Heb., <em>ne&#x2B9;phesh; </em>Gr., <em>psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9;</em>), for they refer to different things.

As has been shown, the soul (<em>ne&#x2B9;phesh; psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9;</em>) is the creature itself. The spirit (<em>ru&#x2B9;ach; pneu&#x2B9;ma</em>) generally refers to the life-force of the living creature or soul, though the original-language terms may also have other meanings.Illustrating further the distinction between the Greek <em>psy&#xB7;khe&#x2B9; </em>and <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma </em>is the apostle Paul&#x2019;s discussion, in his first letter to the Corinthians, of the resurrection of Christians to spirit life. Here he contrasts &#x201C;that which is physical [<em>psy&#xB7;khi&#xB7;kon&#x2B9;, </em>literally, soulical]&#x201D; with &#x201C;that which is spiritual [<em>pneu&#xB7;ma&#xB7;ti&#xB7;kon&#x2B9;</em>].&#x201D; Thus, he shows that Christians until the time of their death have a &#x201C;soulical&#x201D; body, even as did the first man Adam; whereas, in their resurrection such anointed Christians receive a spiritual body like that of the glorified Jesus Christ.
