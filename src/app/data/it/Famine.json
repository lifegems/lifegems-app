Marked lethargy sets in, the emotions are dulled, and there is mental apathy. The mind is dominated by a desire for food. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001489/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 16:3</a>.) Moral standards fall.

One text describes a period of seven years of low Nile risings and the resulting famine. According to the account, certain portions of land were granted to the priesthood when relief from the famine came. Although the question is raised as to whether the document is &#x201C;a priestly forgery of some late period, justifying their claim to territorial privileges,&#x201D; at least we see reflected a tradition of a period of seven lean years.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Pritchard, 1974, p.&#xA0;31.Before Israel entered the Promised Land, Jehovah, through Moses, assured them that they would have an abundance of food if they continued serving Him in faithfulness.
