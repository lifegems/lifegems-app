(See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004399/0\">BETAH</a>.) Some suggest that Tibhath may have been named for Nahor&#x2019;s son Tebah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004399/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:24</a>) In harmony with its being part of the Aramaean kingdom of Zobah, the location of Tibhath was probably in the valley lying between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains. Traces of ancient copperworks have been found in Lebanon, in harmony with the Biblical account."}
