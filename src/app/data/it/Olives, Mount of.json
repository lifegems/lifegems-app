Mount Scopus, the highest and most northerly, rises to about 820&#xA0;m (2,700&#xA0;ft) and, hence, higher than the general elevation of Jerusalem. The so-called Mount of Offense, or Mount of Ruination, is the most southerly of the summits and rises to about 740&#xA0;m (2,430&#xA0;ft). The central summit, across from the Temple Mount, is about 812&#xA0;m (2,664&#xA0;ft) at its highest point and is the one generally referred to in the Bible as the Mount of Olives. Anciently, this ridge was covered with palm, myrtle, oil, and, particularly, olive trees. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003318/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 8:15</a>) From the olive trees this range got its name. During the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70&#xA0;C.E., however, the Mount of Olives was denuded of its trees.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Jewish War, </em>V, 523 (xii,&#xA0;4).Notable events of Bible history are associated with the Mount of Olives. King David, barefoot and weeping, ascended the Mount of Olives as he fled from his rebellious son Absalom.
