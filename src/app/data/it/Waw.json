In pronunciation this letter corresponds generally to the English &#x201C;w,&#x201D; as in &#x201C;wine&#x201D;; at times, however, in modern Hebrew it is given the sound of English &#x201C;v.&#x201D; In this work it is transliterated as &#x201C;w&#x201D; (&#x5D5;), &#x201C;u&#x201D; (&#x5D5;&#x5BC;), and &#x201C;oh&#x201D; (&#x5D5;&#x5B9;). Apart from its use as a prefix, it is rarely used as an initial letter, usually being substituted for by the letter <em>yohdh </em>(&#x5D9;). In the Hebrew, it appears at the beginning of each of the eight verses of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004586/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 119:41-48</a>."}
