This was demonstrated in connection with the tabernacle arrangement and the later temple service. At their installation, High Priest Aaron and his sons bathed before donning the official garments.

If anyone refused to comply with this regulation, he &#x201C;must be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because it is Jehovah&#x2019;s sanctuary that he has defiled.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000579/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 19:20</a>) Appropriately, then, washing is used figuratively to denote a clean standing before Jehovah.
