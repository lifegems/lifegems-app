Zebah and Zalmunna were rulers presumably for the seven years that Midian made raids against Israel, ruining fields and bringing about poverty.

As Gideon was bringing Zebah and Zalmunna back as humiliated captives at least as far as Succoth, they must have been reminded of their boastful words (or at least the expression of their attitude) preserved in the psalm: &#x201C;Let us take possession of the abiding places of God for ourselves.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004671/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 83:11,&#xA0;12</a>) After they admitted to having killed his brothers, Gideon personally put to death the two Midianite kings.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004671/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 8:4-21</a>."}
