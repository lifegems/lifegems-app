I have also come off winner!&#x201D; The name given to this son, Naphtali (meaning &#x201C;My Wrestlings&#x201D;), appropriately expressed Rachel&#x2019;s feelings at the time of his birth.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 30:2-8</a>.Later, Naphtali himself became the father of four sons, Jahzeel (Jahziel), Guni, Jezer, and Shillem (Shallum).

As part of the three-tribe division of the camp of Dan, the tribe of Naphtali, along with Dan and Asher, was last in the order of march and occupied the important position of rear guard.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 1:15, 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:25-31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 7:78;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:25-28</a>.By the time a second census was taken about four decades after the Exodus from Egypt, the number of able-bodied men in the tribe had dropped to 45,400.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">De 34:1,&#xA0;2</a>) On the E it was bounded by the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River. For some distance the territory of Asher extended along the W border. The region assigned to Zebulun bounded Naphtali both on the W and S, and Issachar lay to the S. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:32-34</a>.)

In this case &#x201C;Judah&#x201D; probably refers to the region E of the Jordan occupied by the family of Jair. Although reckoned as a Manassite by reason of his paternal grandmother (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 32:41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Jos 13:29,&#xA0;30</a>), Jair, through his paternal grandfather, was a descendant of Judah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 2:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> 21,&#xA0;22</a>) So the region given to the family of Jair might appropriately be called Judah on the basis of Jair&#x2019;s ancestry.Included in the territory of Naphtali were 19 fortified cities and their settlements. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:35-39</a>) One of these cities, Kedesh, was given to the Levites and assigned a sacred status as a city of refuge.

Especially fertile are the triangular plain (of Gennesaret) on the NW side of the Sea of Galilee and the Hula region. Moses&#x2019; blessing directed to Naphtali perhaps alludes to the land inheritance of the tribe. &#x201C;Naphtali is satisfied with the approval and full of the blessing of Jehovah. Do take possession of the west and south.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">De 33:23</a>) &#x201C;West&#x201D; may also be rendered &#x201C;sea&#x201D; (<em>AS </em>ftn) or &#x201C;lake&#x201D; (<em>RS</em>) and therefore could denote the Sea of Galilee; and &#x201C;south&#x201D; perhaps designates the southernmost territory of Naphtali bordering on that sea. There is also a possibility that the text, though alluding to the Sea of Galilee, should read: &#x201C;The sea and its fish are his possession.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>NW </em>ftn.<strong>From the Time of Judges to the Exile. </strong>In his deathbed prophecy Jacob had referred to Naphtali as &#x201C;a slender hind.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003180/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:21</a>) This may have alluded to the tribe&#x2019;s swiftness and skillfulness in warfare, and the history of the tribe appears to bear this out. Ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun courageously responded to Barak&#x2019;s call to battle against the well-equipped forces under the command of Sisera and, thereafter, were blessed with victory. Barak himself evidently was of the tribe of Naphtali, as Kedesh in Naphtali was apparently his home.

From as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, food was brought for the feasting done in connection with that event.
