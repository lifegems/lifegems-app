Hence, since stars can refer to kings (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004061/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 24:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004061/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 22:16</a>), &#x201C;the stars of God&#x201D; must be the kings of the Davidic line who ruled from Mount Zion. The &#x201C;king of Babylon&#x201D; (the dynasty of Babylonian kings), reflecting the attitude of Satan the god of this system of things, indicated his ambition to lift up his throne &#x201C;above the stars of God&#x201D; by desiring to make the kings of the line of David mere vassals and then finally to dethrone them. Like stars that shed light, the &#x201C;king of Babylon&#x201D; shone brightly in the ancient world and could be termed &#x201C;shining one.&#x201D;"}
