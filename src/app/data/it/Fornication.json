Even if her father refused to give him the girl in marriage, the man had to pay the purchase price to the father.

If her husband falsely charged her with such a crime, it was regarded as bringing great reproach on her father&#x2019;s house. For his slanderous action, the man was to be &#x201C;disciplined&#x201D; by the judges, perhaps by beating, and fined 100 silver shekels ($220), the money then being given to the father.

Fornication between married persons (adultery) was a violation of the seventh commandment and merited the death penalty for both parties.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 20:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> De 5:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/13/2\" data-bid=\"14-3\" class=\"b\"> 22:22</a>.If a man committed fornication with a servant girl who had been designated for another man, but who had not been redeemed or freed, punishment was to take place, but they were not to be put to death. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Le 19:20-22</a>) Evidently this was because the woman was not yet free and in full control of her actions, as a free engaged girl would be. The redemption price had not yet been paid, or at least not fully paid, and she was still a bondservant to her master.When the mercenary prophet Balaam could not bring a curse upon Israel by divination, he found a way to bring them under God&#x2019;s displeasure by appealing to wrong desire for sexual relations. By means of the women of Moab he seduced the Israelites into practicing the filthy phallic worship of the Baal of Peor, for which 24,000 of the sons of Israel died.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 25:1-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 10:8</a> (likely 1,000 heads of the people were killed and hung on stakes [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 25:4</a>] and the rest were destroyed by the sword or the plague).<strong>Forbidden to Christians. </strong>Jesus Christ restored God&#x2019;s original standard of monogamy (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:9</a>) and showed the wickedness of fornication by classing it with murder, thievery, wicked reasoning, false testimony, and blasphemy. He pointed out that these come from within a man, from his heart, and defile him.

Similarly, the Israelites were not to mention the names of the pagan gods<wbr>&#x2014;not that they would fail to warn their children about these gods, but they would not mention them with any esteem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 5:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001555/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\"> Ex 23:13</a>.Fornication is an offense for which an individual may be expelled (disfellowshipped) from the Christian congregation.
