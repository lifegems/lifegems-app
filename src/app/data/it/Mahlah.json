Mahlah and her sisters requested their father&#x2019;s inheritance, since he had no sons but only five daughters. Moses inquired of Jehovah, who ruled that the daughters of Zelophehad should receive it. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002849/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 26:28-33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002849/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 27:1-11</a>) A subsequent order of Jehovah through Moses required Mahlah and the other daughters of Zelophehad to marry within the tribe of Manasseh, to prevent the inheritance from passing to another tribe. Accordingly, Mahlah and her sisters &#x201C;became the wives of the sons of their father&#x2019;s brothers.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002849/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 36:1-6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002849/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 10-12</a>) This judicial decision established a precedent as to inheritance.
