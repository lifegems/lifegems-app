(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000712/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 7:22</a>) Since the Midianites were heading for the region of the Jordan, Beth-shittah must be located somewhere to the E or SE of the hill of Moreh and the well of Harod, in which vicinity the battle took place. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000712/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 7:1</a>) Shattah (Bet Ha-Shitta), about 4.5&#xA0;km (3&#xA0;mi) ESE of modern &#x2BD;En Harod, is suggested by some as the likely location and one giving evidence of the original name. Others consider it too near to the scene of the battle and recommend a location more to the SE, though offering no definite identification."}
