The Hebrew root from which the name is derived seems to be related to an Arabic root verb meaning &#x201C;jump&#x201D; or &#x201C;leap.&#x201D; The arrow snake is mentioned in the prophecy of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000387/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah (34:15</a>) as one of the creatures to inhabit Edom. This would emphasize the fact that Edom was to become such a desolate ruin that it would become a safe place for the arrow snake to &#x2018;make its nest and lay eggs and hatch them and gather them together under its shadow.&#x2019; Most snakes lay eggs, and this text may refer to the practice of some snakes of coiling around their eggs. Says H.&#xA0;W.&#xA0;Parker&#x2019;s book <em>Snakes: A Natural History </em>(1977, p.&#xA0;55): &#x201C;The &#x2018;brooding&#x2019; habit and coiled body give a measure of temperature control as well as protection because the mother can cover or uncover her eggs at will as the weather varies and so ensure a more uniform, and probably higher, temperature; at the same time coiling reduces the exposed surfaces.&#x201D;Samuel Bochart (1599-1667), in his work <em>Hierozoicon </em>(Leipzig, 1796, Vol.&#xA0;3, Part&#xA0;II, Book&#xA0;III, chap.&#xA0;XI, pp.&#xA0;194-204), made a detailed study of the Hebrew word <em>qip&#xB7;pohz&#x2B9; </em>and concluded that it refers to the snake called in Greek <em>a&#xB7;kon&#xB7;ti&#x2B9;as </em>and in Latin <em>jaculus<wbr></em>&#x2014;the arrow snake. However, modern lexicographers are not in agreement regarding the meaning of this Hebrew word."}
