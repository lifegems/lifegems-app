With the exceptions of needed adjustments for modern traffic, the present-day road called Tariq es-Sultan(i) closely follows the ancient Roman highway, portions of which still exist.Apparently the northern portion of this road from Heshbon to Ashtaroth was called &#x201C;the way of Bashan.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002617/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 21:33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002617/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> De 3:1</a>."}
