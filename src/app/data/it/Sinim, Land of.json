(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004139/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 49:12</a>) Reference to the N and W in the same verse suggests that Sinim was S or E of the land of Israel. Instead of &#x201C;Sinim,&#x201D; the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>reads &#x201C;land of the Persians,&#x201D; which could include Elam, called Si-nim in Old Akkadian. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004139/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 11:11</a>.) The Targums and the Latin <em>Vulgate, </em>on the other hand, read &#x201C;[land] to the south.&#x201D; Certain scholars have suggested identification with Syene (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004139/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 30:6</a>) in the southern extremity of Egypt. But Sinim&#x2019;s location is uncertain."}
