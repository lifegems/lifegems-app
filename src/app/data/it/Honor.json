So a person who is honored is regarded as being weighty, or amounting to something. In Greek, the noun <em>ti&#xB7;me&#x2B9; </em>conveys the sense of &#x201C;honor,&#x201D; &#x201C;esteem,&#x201D; &#x201C;value,&#x201D; &#x201C;preciousness.&#x201D; Thus the verb <em>ti&#xB7;ma&#x2B9;o </em>can also mean &#x201C;set a price on&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 27:9</a>); the noun <em>ti&#xB7;me&#x2B9; </em>can have the sense of &#x201C;price,&#x201D; &#x201C;value&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 27:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 4:34</a>); and the adjective <em>ti&#x2B9;mi&#xB7;os </em>can mean &#x201C;esteemed,&#x201D; &#x201C;dear, or valuable,&#x201D; and &#x201C;precious.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 5:34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 3:12</a>.<strong>Jehovah God and His Son. </strong>By reason of his Creatorship and Sovereignty, Jehovah God is deserving of honor, reverential regard or respect. <span id=\"page1136\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1136\" data-before-text=\"1136\"></span>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 1:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 3:3,&#xA0;4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 4:9-11</a>) People render this honor by doing what is pleasing in his sight, as his Son did at all times.

There also needs to be a real love for Jehovah&#x2019;s ways and a heartfelt desire to do his will. This was lacking among the religious leaders of Judaism in the time of Jesus&#x2019; earthly ministry.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 7:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 29:13</a>.Jesus Christ set the perfect example in honoring his Father, carrying out His will flawlessly to the point of laying down his life in sacrifice. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:39;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 10:17,&#xA0;18</a>) Because he delighted to do the Father&#x2019;s will, his Father honored him by acknowledging him as His beloved and approved Son.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Php 2:9-11</a>) The case of Jesus Christ illustrates how the Most High will honor all who honor Him, recognizing them as His approved servants and blessing them beyond measure.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002065/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 2:30</a>.Since it was Jehovah God who highly exalted his Son, all who refuse to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the immortal King of kings and Lord of lords dishonor the Father. Because of who he is and what he has accomplished, the Son deserves honor and loyal support.

Children are to honor their parents by being obedient.

This necessitates guarding against associations that corrupt and resisting the desires of the sinful flesh. Only by remaining morally and spiritually pure does one remain an honorable vessel for God&#x2019;s use.
