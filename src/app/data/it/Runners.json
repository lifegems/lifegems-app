The word is translated from the participial form of the Hebrew word <em>ruts, </em>meaning &#x201C;run.&#x201D; It is rendered &#x201C;footmen,&#x201D; &#x201C;guard,&#x201D; and &#x201C;post&#x201D; in some translations. But there is another word for &#x201C;footmen&#x201D; or &#x201C;men on foot,&#x201D; namely <em>ragh&#xB7;li&#x2B9;, </em>or, more fully, <em>&#x2BC;ish ragh&#xB7;li&#x2B9;.</em>&#x201C;Runners&#x201D; can refer to any swift messengers or fleet-footed persons, such as Asahel the brother of Joab, and Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 2:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:19,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;27</a>) Elijah on one occasion ran perhaps at least 30&#xA0;km (19&#xA0;mi), to arrive from Carmel at Jezreel ahead of King Ahab&#x2019;s chariot. This was because &#x201C;the very hand of Jehovah proved to be upon Elijah.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 18:46</a>.In an official sense, runners were fleet-footed men selected to run before the king&#x2019;s chariot. When Absalom and, later, Adonijah conspired to usurp the kingship, each employed 50 runners before his chariot to add prestige and dignity to his scheme. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 15:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 1:5</a>) Runners served as the king&#x2019;s personal force, somewhat like a modern-day bodyguard. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 22:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 10:25</a>) They served as guards at the entrance to the king&#x2019;s house and accompanied the king from his house to the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 14:27, 28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 11:6-8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 12:10</a>) They carried messages for the king. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 30:6</a>) In the days of Persian King Ahasuerus, foot couriers were apparently replaced by men riding fast post-horses.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Es 3:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 8:10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/6/3\" data-bid=\"7-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;14</a>.<strong>Illustrative Use. </strong>In the Christian Greek Scriptures, there are a few references to running simply in haste. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 28:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 9:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/7/4\" data-bid=\"8-5\" class=\"b\"> Joh 20:2</a>) However, running is used illustratively by the apostle Paul. He wrote to the congregation at Corinth: &#x201C;Do you not know that the runners in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may attain it. Moreover, every man taking part in a contest exercises self-control in all things. Now they, of course, do it that they may get a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one. Therefore, the way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air; but I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 9:24-27</a>.Contestants in the Greek games were strenuously trained, and discipline was rigid; diet and behavior were closely observed. The rules of the race were strictly enforced by the judges. If a runner came in first but had violated the rules, his running was in vain; as the apostle expressed it: &#x201C;Moreover, if anyone contends even in the games, he is not crowned unless he has contended according to the rules.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 2:5</a>) Runners directed their eyes toward the prize located at the finish line. Paul &#x2018;ran&#x2019; in this single-minded, wholehearted way. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 2:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> Php 2:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 3:14</a>) Near the end of his life he was able to say: &#x201C;I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith. From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 4:7,&#xA0;8</a>.In discussing God&#x2019;s dealings in connection with his choosing of those making up spiritual Israel, Paul explained that Israel according to the flesh counted on their fleshly relationship to Abraham. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 9:6, 7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 30-32</a>) They thought they were the chosen ones and &#x2018;ran,&#x2019; or pursued righteousness, but in the wrong way. Trying to establish their righteousness by their own works, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 10:1-3</a>) Paul directs attention to God&#x2019;s justice in rejecting fleshly Israel as a nation and forming a spiritual Israel. In connection with that discussion, he makes the statement that &#x201C;it depends, not upon the one wishing nor upon the one running, but upon God, who has mercy.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003773/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 9:15,&#xA0;16</a>."}
