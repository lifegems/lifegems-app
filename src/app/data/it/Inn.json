Perhaps ancient Middle Eastern inns resembled those built there in more recent times. These commonly consist of a walled square with only one entrance. Along the walls on a raised platform there are unfurnished rooms for sheltering travelers and goods, entrance being gained from the inner courtyard. The animals are left in the large court, which often has a centrally situated well. Innkeepers of ancient times furnished a few necessary provisions to travelers and cared for persons left in their charge, receiving compensation for their services.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002174/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 10:33-35</a>."}
