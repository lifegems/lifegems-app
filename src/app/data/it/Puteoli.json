Paul arrived at Puteoli on his way to stand before Caesar in Rome about the year 59&#xA0;C.E. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003592/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 28:13</a>) With the help of a S wind, his ship arrived &#x201C;on the second day&#x201D; at Puteoli from Rhegium, a place some 320&#xA0;km (200&#xA0;mi) to the SSE.Christian brothers of Puteoli entreated Paul and those accompanying him to spend a week with them. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003592/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 28:14</a>) This indicates he enjoyed some freedom, though a prisoner. Earlier, while in custody at Caesarea and Sidon, Paul had similarly benefited from limited freedom.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003592/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 24:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003592/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 27:3</a>.Puteoli is generally identified with modern Pozzuoli, on the bay of the same name, about 10&#xA0;km (6&#xA0;mi) WSW of Naples. Extensive ruins of an ancient mole still are visible. Josephus calls the site by its older name, Dicaearchia, and says a Jewish colony was located there.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>XVII, 328 (xii,&#xA0;1)."}
