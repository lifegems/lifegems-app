(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004566/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 13:1</a>) Angels, and Jehovah God himself, have been heard to speak in voice sounds and languages audible to men and understandable by them. But it is not to be supposed that such would be the voice with which they communicate with one another in the heavens, for an atmosphere such as exists around the earth is necessary for propagating the sound waves of voice that is audible and understandable to the human ear.The instances in which God or angels spoke in a voice in the hearing of men would therefore be a manifestation of their speech as transformed into sound waves, just as appearances of angels to the vision of man required either a materialization or a transmitting to the human mind of a pictorial image. Today even human scientists can convert the sound-wave pattern of an individual&#x2019;s voice into electric impulses that can be transmitted to a receiver, which can change those impulses back to sounds closely resembling the individual&#x2019;s voice.<strong><em>Have any humans actually heard the voice of God himself?</em></strong>In three instances in the Bible record, Jehovah is reported as speaking audibly to humans. These are: (1)&#xA0;At the time of Jesus&#x2019; baptism (29&#xA0;C.E.), when Jehovah said: &#x201C;This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.&#x201D; Both Jesus and John the Baptizer undoubtedly heard this voice.

Evidently in the last-named instance the crowd did not hear the voice distinctly, since some compared it to thunder. Jehovah undoubtedly was the speaker on those occasions, because Jesus, in connection with whom the statements were made, was God&#x2019;s own Son, closer to the Father than any other creature was.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004566/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 11:27</a>.Speaking to a group of unbelieving Jews, about the time of the Passover of 31&#xA0;C.E., Jesus told them: &#x201C;Also, the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his figure; and you do not have his word remaining in you, because the very one whom he dispatched you do not believe.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004566/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 5:37,&#xA0;38</a>) This unbelieving crowd had never heard God&#x2019;s voice, and they were not obeying his word or even the obvious witness they received through God&#x2019;s support of Jesus&#x2019; works. For that matter, apparently only Jesus and John the Baptizer had heard the audible voice of Jehovah, for the last two instances of Jehovah&#x2019;s speaking had not yet occurred at this point.Biblical mention of Jehovah&#x2019;s &#x201C;voice&#x201D; sometimes refers to the authoritativeness of his command as &#x201C;the voice of God Almighty.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004566/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 10:5</a>, <em>RS.</em><span id=\"page1161\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1161\" data-before-text=\"1161\"></span><strong><em>Angelic voices. </em></strong>On other occasions when God &#x2018;spoke,&#x2019; angels were used as his representatives to provide the vocal manifestation.

When Paul later related the experience, he said that the men &#x201C;did not hear the voice of the one speaking.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004566/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 22:9</a>) In this account the accusative (objective) case <em>pho&#xB7;nen&#x2B9; </em>is used. This can give the sense that, although the <em>sound </em>registered on their ears, they did not hear the voice as being <em>distinct words that they understood </em>as did Saul, to whom Christ was speaking.The apostle Paul said, when writing to the Thessalonian congregation about the gathering of God&#x2019;s anointed holy ones: &#x201C;The Lord [Jesus Christ] himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel&#x2019;s voice and with God&#x2019;s trumpet.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004566/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 4:16</a>) The term &#x201C;archangel&#x201D; means &#x201C;chief angel&#x201D; or &#x201C;principal angel.&#x201D; Paul&#x2019;s expression &#x201C;archangel&#x2019;s voice&#x201D; evidently focuses attention on the authoritativeness of Jesus&#x2019; voice of command. Jesus, when on earth, revealed the authority that God invested in him, when he said: &#x201C;For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself.
