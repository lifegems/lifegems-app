Down through the centuries the needy generally have outnumbered those having much. When accepting an act of generosity, Jesus recognized the hard fact that poverty would persist among humans living in imperfection, saying to his disciples: &#x201C;For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to you can always do them good, but me you do not have always.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003524/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 14:7</a>) The Bible presents a balanced view of the problem, expressing compassion for those suffering under oppressive conditions, while also reproving those who, in effect, &#x2018;eat their own flesh&#x2019; because of indolence.

Then, too, unforeseen circumstances might arise that could plunge persons into poverty. Death could leave behind orphans and widows. Accidents and sickness could temporarily or permanently hinder a person from performing necessary work. For these reasons Jehovah could say to Israel: &#x201C;Someone poor will never cease to be in the midst of the land.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003524/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">De 15:11</a>.The Law, however, did much to make it easier for the poor to cope with their situation.

As God&#x2019;s Son in the heavens, he had had everything. But &#x201C;though he was rich he became poor.&#x201D; As a poor man on earth, he was able to redeem the human race, making available the greatest of riches, that is, the prospect for his followers to become sons of God.
