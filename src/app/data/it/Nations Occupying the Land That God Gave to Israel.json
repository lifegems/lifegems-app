The Bible candidly reports that God decreed the destruction of those wicked nations, and he appointed the Israelites to be the executioners. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001391/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 7:2</a>) Many persons have criticized that action. Others humbly acknowledge that it is hardly appropriate for imperfect humans to set themselves up as judges of God. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001391/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 18:29</a>.) Their desire is to understand God&#x2019;s ways. What do they learn?This record clearly demonstrates that all people are accountable to mankind&#x2019;s Creator, Jehovah God, whether they profess to believe in him or not. It shows that God is patient but does not shut his eyes to wrongdoing. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001391/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 15:16</a>) It makes clear that Jehovah leaves the responsibility for young children on the shoulders of their parents; he does not relieve the parents of this and thus allow them to feel that their actions affect only themselves.
