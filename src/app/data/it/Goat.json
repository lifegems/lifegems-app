A number of Hebrew and Greek terms are used to refer to male and female goats and their offspring. The common Hebrew term for &#x201C;goat&#x201D; is <em>&#x2BD;ez. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Le 3:12</a>) Another Hebrew term for goat (<em>sa&#xB7;&#x2BD;ir&#x2B9;</em>) literally means &#x201C;hairy.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 27:11</a>, where a word of the same form and from the same root is rendered &#x201C;hairy.&#x201D;) The male leader of a flock of goats was denoted by the Hebrew term <em>&#x2BD;at&#xB7;tudh&#x2B9;, </em>rendered &#x2018;he-goat.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 7:17</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 50:8</a>, ftn.)

Monuments are still extant in which this symbol occurs, as one of the pilasters of Persepolis, where a goat is depicted with one immense horn on his forehead, and a Persian holding the horn, by which is intended the subjection of Macedon by Persia&#x201D; (something accomplished by the Persians toward the close of the sixth century B.C.E.).<strong>Mountain Goat, Wild Goat. </strong>The Hebrew designation <em>ye&#x2BD;e&#xB7;lim&#x2B9;, </em>rendered &#x201C;mountain goats&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>) and &#x201C;wild goats&#x201D; (<em>KJ</em>), is generally understood to refer to the Nubian ibex (<em>Capra ibex nubiana</em>), a mountain-dwelling wild goat with large, heavily ridged, backward-curving horns. This animal is at home in the high mountains (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 104:18</a>), where it negotiates jagged crags and narrow mountain ledges with graceful ease. During the period of gestation these goats seek out places not easily found by man. This may be alluded to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Job 39:1</a>, where the question raised points up the fact that these creatures are quite independent of man, the birth of their young taking place unobserved by man.The account at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel chapter&#xA0;24</a> tells of Saul&#x2019;s pursuing David into the rocky area of En-gedi (meaning &#x201C;Fountain (Spring) of the Kid&#x201D;) on the western side of the Dead Sea. The pursuers looked for David and his men upon &#x201C;the bare rocks of the mountain goats&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 24:2</a>), suggesting that mountain goats inhabited this region. Even in recent times the ibex has been seen there.The feminine Hebrew form <em>ya&#xB7;&#x2BD;alah&#x2B9; </em>is employed in the passage at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 5:18,&#xA0;19</a>. Here the wife of one&#x2019;s youth is compared to &#x201C;a charming mountain goat,&#x201D; the allusion possibly being to the grace of this animal.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 14:4, 5</a>, where the reference is to animals acceptable for food, the Hebrew word <em>&#x2BC;aq&#xB7;qoh&#x2B9; </em>has been translated &#x201C;wild goat.&#x201D; (<em>AS, KJ, NW, RS</em>) Many scholars believe that <em>&#x2BC;aq&#xB7;qoh&#x2B9; </em>may designate the same animal as <em>ye&#x2BD;e&#xB7;lim&#x2B9;, </em>that is, the Nubian ibex."}
