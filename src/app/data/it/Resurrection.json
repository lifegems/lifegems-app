The Hebrew Scriptures at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Hosea 13:14</a>, quoted by the apostle Paul (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:54,&#xA0;55</a>), speak of the abolition of death and the rendering powerless of Sheol (Heb., <em>she&#x2BC;ohl&#x2B9;; </em>Gr., <em>hai&#x2B9;des</em>)<em>. She&#x2BC;ohl&#x2B9; </em>is rendered in various versions as &#x201C;grave&#x201D; and &#x201C;pit.&#x201D; The dead are spoken of as going there. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 37:35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 2:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Ec 9:10</a>) Its usage in the Scriptures, along with the usage of its Greek equivalent <em>hai&#x2B9;des </em>in the Christian Greek Scriptures, shows that it refers, not to an individual grave, but to the common grave of mankind, gravedom. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 32:21-32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 20:13</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/0\">HADES</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/1\">SHEOL</a>.) To render Sheol powerless would mean to loosen its hold on those in it, which would imply the emptying of gravedom. This, of course, would require a resurrection, a raising up from the lifeless condition of death or out of the grave for those there.<strong>Through Jesus Christ. </strong>The foregoing shows that the teaching of resurrection appears in the Hebrew Scriptures. Nevertheless, it remained for Jesus Christ to &#x201C;shed light upon life and incorruption through the good news.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 1:10</a>) Jesus said: &#x201C;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:6</a>) Just how <em>everlasting life </em>would come, and more than that, <em>incorruption </em>for some, was brought to light through the good news about Jesus Christ. The apostle affirms that the resurrection is a sure hope, arguing: &#x201C;Now if Christ is being preached that he has been raised up from the dead, how is it some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead? If, indeed, there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised up. But if Christ has not been raised up, our preaching is certainly in vain, and our faith is in vain. Moreover, we are also found false witnesses of God, because we have borne witness against God that he raised up the Christ, but whom he did not raise up if the dead are really not to be raised up. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Further, if Christ has not been raised up, your faith is useless; you are yet in your sins. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death. For since death is through a man, <em>resurrection of the dead is also through a man.&#x201D;<wbr></em>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:12-21</a>.<span id=\"page784\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"784\" data-before-text=\"784\"></span>Christ himself when on earth performed resurrections.

God, because of his power, &#x201C;makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they were.&#x201D; Paul includes this fact when speaking of Abraham&#x2019;s faith.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 22:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 31-33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> Ro 4:17</a>.<strong><em>God&#x2019;s ability to resurrect. </em></strong>For the One with the ability and power to create man in His own image, with a perfect body and with the potential for full expression of the marvelous characteristics implanted in the human personality, it would pose no insurmountable problem to resurrect an individual. If scientific principles established by God can be used by scientists to preserve and later reconstruct a visible and audible scene by means of videotape, how easy it is for the great Universal Sovereign and Creator to resurrect a person by repatterning the same personality in a newly formed body. Concerning the revitalizing of Sarah to have a child in her old age, the angel said: &#x201C;Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 18:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 32:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;27</a>.<strong>How the Need for Resurrection Arose. </strong>In the beginning a resurrection was not necessary. It was not a part of God&#x2019;s original purpose for mankind, because death was not the natural, purposed thing for humans. Rather, God indicated that he purposed the earth to be full of <em>living </em>humans, not a deteriorating, dying race. His work was perfect, hence without flaw, imperfection, or sickness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">De 32:4</a>) Jehovah blessed the first human pair, telling them to multiply and fill the earth. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:28</a>) Such blessing certainly did not include sickness and death; God set no limited life span for man, but he told Adam that disobedience is what would cause death. This implies that man would otherwise live forever. Disobedience would incur God&#x2019;s disfavor and remove his blessing, bringing a curse.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:17-19</a>.Consequently, death was introduced into the human race by the transgression of Adam. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:12</a>) Because of their father&#x2019;s sinfulness and resultant imperfection, Adam&#x2019;s offspring could not get a heritage of everlasting life from him; in fact, not even a <em>hope </em>of living forever. &#x201C;Neither can a rotten tree produce fine fruit,&#x201D; said Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:17, 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Job 14:1,&#xA0;2</a>) The resurrection was brought in, or <em>added, </em>to overcome this disability for those of Adam&#x2019;s children who would desire to be obedient to God.<strong>Purpose of the Resurrection. </strong>The resurrection shows forth not only Jehovah&#x2019;s unlimited power and wisdom but also his love and his mercy and vindicates him as the Preserver of those who serve him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 2:6</a>) Having resurrection power, he can go to the extent of showing that his servants will be faithful to him to the very death. He can answer Satan&#x2019;s accusation that asserted that &#x201C;skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Job 2:4</a>) Jehovah can let Satan go the full limit, even to killing some in a vain effort to support his false accusations. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 2:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/18/2\" data-bid=\"19-3\" class=\"b\"> 6:11</a>) The fact that Jehovah&#x2019;s servants are willing to give up life itself in his service proves their service is, not for selfish considerations, but out of love. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Re 12:11</a>) It also proves that they acknowledge Him as the Almighty, the Universal Sovereign, and the God of love, who is able to resurrect them. It proves they render exclusive devotion to Jehovah for his wonderful qualities and not for selfish material reasons. (Consider some of the exclamations of his servants, as recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 11:33-36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 4:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> 7:12</a>.) The resurrection also is a means by which Jehovah sees that his purpose toward the earth, as stated to Adam, is carried out.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:28</a>.<strong><em>Essential to man&#x2019;s happiness. </em></strong>The resurrection of the dead, an undeserved kindness on God&#x2019;s part, is essential to mankind&#x2019;s happiness and to the undoing of all the harm, suffering, and oppression that have come upon the human race. These things have befallen man as a result of his imperfection and sickness, the wars he has waged, the murders committed, and the inhumanities practiced by wicked people at the instance of Satan the Devil. We cannot be completely happy if we do not believe in a resurrection. The apostle Paul expressed the feeling in these words: &#x201C;If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:19</a>.<strong>How Early Was Resurrection Hope Given? </strong>After Adam had sinned and had brought death upon himself and thereby introduced death for those who would be his posterity, God, in addressing the serpent, said: &#x201C;And I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:15</a>.<span id=\"page785\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"785\" data-before-text=\"785\"></span><strong><em>One originally causing death to be removed. </em></strong>Jesus said to the religious Jews who opposed him: &#x201C;You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father.

In the vision that Christ later gave to John, he revealed that Satan the Devil is also called &#x201C;the original serpent.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Re 12:9</a>) Satan got his hold on mankind, gaining influence over Adam&#x2019;s children, by inducing their father Adam to rebel against God. So in the first prophecy, of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 3:15</a>, Jehovah gave hope that this Serpent would be put out of the way. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 16:20</a>.) Not only is Satan&#x2019;s head to be crushed but also all of his works are to be broken up, destroyed, or undone. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 3:8</a>; <em>NW, KJ, AT</em>) The fulfillment of this prophecy would of necessity require the undoing of the death introduced by Adam, including bringing back by a resurrection those of Adam&#x2019;s offspring who go into Sheol (Hades) as a result of his sin, the effects of which they inherit.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:26</a>.<strong><em>Hope of freedom entails resurrection. </em></strong>The apostle Paul describes the situation that God permitted to exist following man&#x2019;s fall into sin and His end purpose in doing so: &#x201C;For the creation was subjected to futility [being born in sin and with death facing all], not by its own will [the children of Adam were brought into the world facing this situation, though they themselves had no control over what Adam had done, and by no choice of their own] but through him [God, in his wisdom] that subjected it, on the basis of hope that the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:20, 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/30/1\" data-bid=\"31-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 51:5</a>) In order to experience the fulfillment of this hope of glorious freedom, those who have died would have to have a resurrection; they would have to be freed from death and the grave.

The terms &#x201C;hear&#x201D; and &#x201C;listen&#x201D; are used very frequently in the Bible with the meaning of &#x201C;give heed&#x201D; or &#x201C;obey.&#x201D; (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/4\">OBEDIENCE</a>.)

They are judged, not on what they did <em>before </em>hearing his voice, but on what they do <em>after </em>hearing it.Jesus was therefore evidently taking a similar position in time in speaking of &#x201C;those who did good things&#x201D; and &#x201C;those who practiced vile things,&#x201D; namely, a position at the end of the period of judgment, as looking back in retrospect or in review of the actions of these resurrected persons <em>after </em>they had opportunity to obey or disobey the &#x201C;things written in the scrolls.&#x201D; Only at the end of the judgment period would it be demonstrated who had done good or bad. The outcome to &#x201C;those who did good things&#x201D; (according to &#x201C;those things written in the scrolls&#x201D;) would be the reward of life; to &#x201C;those who practiced vile things,&#x201D; a judgment of condemnation. The resurrection would have turned out to be either to life or to condemnation.The practice of stating things as viewed from the standpoint of the outcome, or stating them as already accomplished, considering them in retrospect, is common in the Bible.

Consequently, in the resurrection there is no joining again of soul and body. However, whether spiritual or earthly, the individual must have a body or organism, for all persons, heavenly or earthly, possess bodies. To be again a person, one who has died would have to have a body, either a physical or a spiritual body. The Bible says: &#x201C;If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/132/0\" data-bid=\"133-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:44</a>.But is the old body reassembled in the resurrection? or is it a precise replica of the former body, made exactly as it was when the person died?

Yes, with what sort of body are they coming?&#x2019; You unreasonable person! What you sow is not made alive unless first it dies; and as for what you sow, you sow, not the body that will develop, but a bare grain, it may be, of wheat or any one of the rest; but God gives it a body just as it has pleased him, and to each of the seeds its own body.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/133/0\" data-bid=\"134-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:35-38</a>.The heavenly ones receive a spiritual body, for it pleases God for them to have bodies suitable for their heavenly environment. But those whom Jehovah pleases to raise to an earthly resurrection, what body does he give them? It could not be the same body, of exactly the same atoms. If a man dies and is buried, by process of decay his body is reconverted into chemicals that can be absorbed by vegetation. Persons may eat that vegetation. The elements, the atoms of that original person, now are in many persons. In the resurrection it is obvious that the same atoms cannot be in the original person and in all the others at the same time.Neither is the resurrected body necessarily one constructed to be the exact duplicate of the body at the moment of death. If a person has had his body mutilated before death, will he return in the same way?

He said about each one of such: &#x201C;He does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life. Most truly I say to you, The hour is coming, and <em>it is now, </em>when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have given heed will live.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/138/0\" data-bid=\"139-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 5:24,&#xA0;25</a>.Those who have &#x2018;passed over from death to life <em>now&#x2019; </em>would not be those who had literally died and were in actual graves. At the time when Jesus spoke, all mankind were under the condemnation of death before God the Judge of all. So the ones Jesus referred to were evidently persons on earth who had been dead in a spiritual sense. Jesus must have referred to such spiritually dead ones when he said to the Jewish son who wanted to go home first to bury his father: &#x201C;Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/139/0\" data-bid=\"140-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 8:21,&#xA0;22</a>.Those who become Christians with true belief were once among the spiritually dead people of the world. The apostle Paul reminded the congregation of this fact, saying: &#x201C;It is you God made alive though you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you at one time walked according to the system of things of this world .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/143/0\" data-bid=\"144-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:16</a>) The apostle Paul comforts fellow Christians with the resurrection hope, writing to the congregation at Thessalonica about those of the congregation who had died and who had hope of a heavenly resurrection: &#x201C;Moreover, brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant concerning those who are sleeping in death; that you may not sorrow just as the rest also do who have no hope.

It would fall short of accomplishing the full purpose for which God provided it, because God&#x2019;s purpose was that the Kingdom have earthly subjects. Jesus Christ is High Priest not only over the underpriests with him but also for the world of mankind who will live when his associates also rule as kings and priests with him.

Christ&#x2019;s ransom covers the sins an individual has because of being a child of sinful Adam, but a person can add to that by his own deliberate, willful course of sin, and he can thus die for such sin that is beyond coverage by the ransom.<strong><em>Sin against the holy spirit. </em></strong>Jesus Christ said that one who sinned against the holy spirit would not be forgiven in the present system of things nor in that to come. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/154/0\" data-bid=\"155-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:31,&#xA0;32</a>) A person whom God judged as having sinned against the holy spirit in the present system of things would therefore not profit by a resurrection, since his sins would never be forgiven, making resurrection useless for him. Jesus uttered judgment against Judas Iscariot in calling him &#x201C;the son of destruction.&#x201D; The ransom would not apply to him, and his destruction already being a judicially established judgment, he would not receive a resurrection.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/155/0\" data-bid=\"156-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 17:12</a>.To his opposers, the Jewish religious leaders, Jesus said: &#x201C;How are you to flee from the judgment of Gehenna [a symbol of everlasting destruction]?&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/156/0\" data-bid=\"157-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 23:33</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/7\">GEHENNA</a>.) His words indicate that these persons, if they did not take action to turn to God before their death, would have a final adverse judgment entered against them.

The apostle goes on to liken such ones to a field that produces only thorns and thistles and is therefore rejected and ends up being burned. This illustrates the future before them: complete annihilation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/158/0\" data-bid=\"159-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 6:4-8</a>.Again, Paul says of those who &#x201C;practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, [that] there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and there is a fiery jealousy that is going to consume those in opposition.&#x201D; He then illustrates: &#x201C;Any man that has disregarded the law of Moses dies without compassion, upon the testimony of two or three. Of how much more severe a punishment, do you think, will the man be counted worthy who has trampled upon the Son of God and who has esteemed as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt? .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#x201D; The judgment is <em>more severe </em>in that such ones are not merely killed and buried in Sheol, as were violators of the Law of Moses.

However, by way of illustration, if Jehovah resurrects 20&#xA0;billion (20,000,000,000) people, there would be no problem as to living space and food for them. The land surface of the earth at present is about 148,000,000 sq&#xA0;km (57,000,000 sq&#xA0;mi), or about 14,800,000,000 ha (36,500,000,000&#xA0;acres). Even allowing half of that to be set aside for other uses, there would be more than a third of a hectare (almost 1&#xA0;acre) for each person. As to earth&#x2019;s potential food production, a third of a hectare will actually provide much more than enough food for one person, especially when, as God has demonstrated in the case of the nation of Israel, there is abundance of food as a result of God&#x2019;s blessing.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/163/0\" data-bid=\"164-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/163/1\" data-bid=\"164-2\" class=\"b\"> Eze 34:27</a>.On the question of the earth&#x2019;s food-producing power, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization maintains that, with only moderate improvements in agricultural methods, in even the developing areas the earth could easily feed up to nine times the population that scientists have estimated for the year 2000.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Land, Food and People, </em>Rome, 1984, pp.&#xA0;16,&#xA0;17.How, though, could the thousands of millions be <span id=\"page793\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"793\" data-before-text=\"793\"></span>adequately cared for, in view of the fact that most of them did not in the past know God and must learn to conform to his laws for them?

Thus God, with his almighty power and wisdom, is able to bring his purpose to a glorious conclusion fully within the framework of the laws and arrangements he has made for mankind from the beginning, with the added undeserved kindness of the resurrection.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003709/169/0\" data-bid=\"170-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 11:33-36</a>."}
