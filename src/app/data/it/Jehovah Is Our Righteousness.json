This can be seen from the fact that the similar Messianic prophecy at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002393/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 33:14-16</a> applies the identical expression to Jerusalem, saying: &#x201C;And this is what she will be called, Jehovah Is Our Righteousness.&#x201D; In both cases the expression shows that God&#x2019;s name, Jehovah, placed both upon his promised king and upon his chosen capital, is a guarantee of their righteousness. Moreover, the justice and righteousness emanating from or expressed by these sources are the product of full devotion to Jehovah and his divine will, bringing Jehovah&#x2019;s blessing and direction."}
