(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 35:26</a>) Thus Asher&#x2019;s only full brother was Gad. Asher&#x2019;s four sons and one daughter are listed at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 7:30</a>, though his wife is not named. He was not prominent among the 12 sons of Jacob. However, in his father&#x2019;s deathbed prophecy, Asher was promised a life blessed with an abundance of rich foods (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:20</a>), and the history of his descendants demonstrates the fulfillment of this prediction.<strong>2. </strong>The name applies as well to the tribe descended from Asher. A year after the Exodus from Egypt the tribe&#x2019;s adult male descendants numbered 41,500 (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 1:41</a>) and, about 39 years later, had increased to 53,400, making it the fifth most populous tribe. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 26:47</a>) In the camp of Israel, Asher occupied a position N of the tabernacle, with the tribes of Dan and Naphtali.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 2:25-30</a>.Prior to entry into Canaan, Moses&#x2019; prophetic blessing again predicted a prosperous portion for Asher. The tribe was figuratively to &#x2018;dip its foot in oil.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">De 33:24, 25</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Job 29:6</a>.) Their allotment of territory stretched along the Mediterranean coastal plains from below the town of Dor, S of Mount Carmel, on up to the N boundary of Palestine at Sidon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:7-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000414/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:24-31</a>) This included some of the most fertile land in all Israel, where olive trees would provide abundant oil, while other fruits would provide dainties fit to grace a royal table.

Asher is also referred to in this same account at verse&#xA0;10, where it clearly refers to the tribal territory of Asher."}
