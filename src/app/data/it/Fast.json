Fasting was one such practice, and they thought it should gain them divine notice and favor. This failing, they asked in apparent bewilderment: &#x201C;For what reason did we fast and you did not see, and did we afflict our soul and you would take no note?&#x201D; Jehovah told them why. Even during the fast, while asking for his righteous judgments and acting as if they carried on righteousness itself, they were pursuing their own pleasure and business, indulging in strife, oppression, and violence; they showed none of the godly sorrow and repentance associated with sincere fasts. Their fast was not such as to make their voice heard in heaven, though their showy wailings were noisy indeed. Jehovah denounced the hypocritical act they put on: &#x201C;Should the fast that I choose become like this, as a day for earthling man to afflict his soul? For bowing down his head just like a rush, and that he should spread out mere sackcloth and ashes as his couch? Is it this that you call a fast and a day acceptable to Jehovah?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001492/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 58:1-5</a>.To be acceptable, the fast must be accompanied by a correction of past sins. Through his prophet Isaiah, Jehovah made known what he considered to be a real fast, saying: &#x201C;Is not this the fast that I choose? To loosen the fetters of wickedness, to release the bands of the yoke bar, and to send <span id=\"page812\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"812\" data-before-text=\"812\"></span>away the crushed ones free, and that you people should tear in two every yoke bar? Is it not the dividing of your bread out to the hungry one, and that you should bring the afflicted, homeless people into your house?

Truly I say to you, They are having their reward in full. But you, when fasting, grease your head and wash your face, that you may appear to be fasting, not to men, but to your Father who is in secrecy; then your Father who is looking on in secrecy will repay you.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001492/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:16-18</a>) He alluded here to the insincere fasting of the Pharisees, which he mentioned in an illustration on another occasion.

When Jesus was talking to his disciples about fasting, as above (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001492/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:16-18</a>), he and his disciples were still under the Mosaic Law and observed the Day of Atonement and its fast.The text about fasting at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001492/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 17:21</a>, appearing in the <em>King James Version, </em>is not contained in some of the most important ancient manuscripts.

In reality, Jesus was merely making a statement of what was going to happen when he died. While Jesus was with his disciples on earth, it was not appropriate for them to fast. When he died, they did mourn and fast. But they had no cause for mournful fasting after his resurrection and especially after the marvelous outpouring of holy spirit.
