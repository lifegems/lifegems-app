The sound represented by the letter corresponds to an emphatic English &#x201C;t,&#x201D; produced by pressing the tongue strongly against the palate. Its sound differs from that of the letter <em>taw </em>[&#x5EA;] primarily because of its lack of aspiration after the &#x201C;t&#x201D; sound. In the original Hebrew, it appears at the beginning of each verse of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004342/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 119:65-72</a>."}
