Likely those used by the Israelites were similar.<span id=\"page649\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"649\" data-before-text=\"649\"></span>The methods of dragnet fishing used anciently were probably much like those employed in the Middle East in more recent times. The dragnet was let down from boats in such a way as to surround a school of fish, and the long ropes attached to the opposite ends of the net were taken ashore, where several men on each rope gradually pulled the net as a semicircle to the beach. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001219/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 13:47,&#xA0;48</a>) Another method was to draw the net together in a narrowing circle. Fishermen then dived into the water and pulled a portion of the weighted edge under the rest of the net, thus forming a bottom. After this, the net was drawn into a boat or boats. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001219/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 5:6,&#xA0;7</a>) Sometimes the net was first dragged into shallower water before being emptied.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001219/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 21:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001219/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;11</a>.In the Scriptures, the dragnet is used figuratively with reference to the gathering of people.
