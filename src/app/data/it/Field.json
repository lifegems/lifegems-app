In going out to &#x201C;the field,&#x201D; Ruth by chance &#x201C;lighted on the tract of the field belonging to Boaz,&#x201D; indicating that Boaz owned only a section of the area.

Perhaps by planting this inferior grade of wheat around the outer edges of their fields, farmers could, to some extent, protect their more valuable crops, such as wheat and barley, from cattle that might enter the edges of the field.Likely it was possible to go through the field by means of footpaths, and these could also have served to separate one tract of land from another, for it is most improbable that Jesus and his disciples would have walked right through a field of grain, trampling some of the grain as they went along. If they had done this, the Pharisees undoubtedly would have taken issue on this point also.
