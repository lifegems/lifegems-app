Since the fourth century C.E. this field has been identified with a location on the S slope of the Hinnom Valley, just before it joins the Kidron Valley.The expression &#x201C;the potter&#x2019;s field&#x201D; does not specifically indicate whether the field was one simply owned by a potter or was called that because, at some point in its history, it was an area where potters pursued their craft. The latter, though, <span id=\"page659\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"659\" data-before-text=\"659\"></span>seems probable if the traditional site is correct. It would be near the Gate of the Potsherds (or &#x201C;Gate of the Potters,&#x201D; according to J.&#xA0;Simons in his footnote in <em>Jerusalem in the Old Testament, </em>Leiden, 1952, p.&#xA0;230), mentioned in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003538/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 19:1,&#xA0;2</a>. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003538/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 18:2</a>.) Even in recent times the necessary raw material, clay, has been available in the vicinity. Also, making pottery required a good water supply, and the site was close to the spring at En-rogel and the Pool of Siloam as well as near such water as might be in the Hinnom Valley in the winter."}
