(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 3:15</a>) The apostle Paul tells us that God is to be given glory &#x201C;to all generations forever and ever.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 3:21</a>.A generation may mean a <em>class </em>of persons, that is, those characterized by certain qualities or conditions.

These limits would be determined by the life span of the people of that time <span id=\"page918\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"918\" data-before-text=\"918\"></span>or of that population. The life span of the ten generations from Adam to Noah averaged more than 850 years each.

Moses wrote: &#x201C;In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years, yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things; for it must quickly pass by, and away we fly.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 90:10</a>) Some few may live longer, but Moses stated the general rule. Moses himself, who lived 120 years, was an exception, as were his brother Aaron (123 years), Joshua (110 years), and some others whose strength and vitality were unusual.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">De 34:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> Nu 33:39;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> Jos 24:29</a>.<strong>&#x201C;This Generation&#x201D; of Christ&#x2019;s Prophecies. </strong>When Bible prophecy speaks of &#x201C;this generation,&#x201D; it is necessary to consider the context to determine what generation is meant. Jesus Christ, when denouncing the Jewish religious leaders, concluded by saying: &#x201C;Truly I say to you, All these things will come upon this generation.&#x201D; History recounts that about 37 years later (in 70&#xA0;C.E.) that contemporary generation personally experienced the destruction of Jerusalem, as foretold.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 23:36</a>.Later that same day, Jesus again used practically the same words, saying: &#x201C;Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:34</a>) In this instance, Jesus was answering a question regarding the desolation of Jerusalem and its temple as well as regarding the sign of his presence and of the conclusion of the system of things. So his comment about &#x201C;this generation&#x201D; logically had an application down to 70&#xA0;C.E. However, he was also using the word &#x201C;generation&#x201D; with reference to humans whose lives would in some way be associated with the foretold events during his presence.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001648/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Mt&#xA0;24</a>."}
