As Eleazar died without sons, having had only daughters, the sons of Kish took these heiresses as wives. One of &#x201C;the sons of Kish&#x201D; was Jerahmeel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002631/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 23:21, 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002631/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 24:29</a>.<strong>2. </strong>A Benjamite; the son of Jeiel and his wife Maacah.
