Then John heard the proclamation: &#x201C;And the spirit and the bride keep on saying: &#x2018;Come!&#x2019; And let anyone hearing say: &#x2018;Come!&#x2019; And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life&#x2019;s water free.&#x201D; Evidently this invitation would be extended by God&#x2019;s servants for thirsty ones to <em>begin </em>drinking of God&#x2019;s provisions for gaining eternal life through the Lamb of God. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:29</a>) They could get what is now available of this water of life.

Paul brought the good news of the Kingdom to the Corinthians, planting seed in the Corinthian &#x201C;field.&#x201D; Apollos came afterward and by his further teaching nourished and cultivated the seed sown, but God, by his spirit, brought growth. Paul used this illustration to emphasize the fact that no individual human is important in himself, but all are ministers, working together as God&#x2019;s workmen. God is the important One, and he blesses such unselfish, unified work.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 3:5-9</a>.<strong><em>God&#x2019;s word of truth. </em></strong>God&#x2019;s word of truth is likened to water that cleanses.

Referring back to the tabernacle and the requirement that the priests wash in water before entering the sanctuary to serve, he says: &#x201C;Since we have a great priest [Jesus Christ] over the house of God, let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith, having had .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. our bodies bathed with clean water.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:21,&#xA0;22</a>) This cleansing involves not only the knowledge of God&#x2019;s word but also its application in their daily lives.<strong><em>The water of baptism. </em></strong>Jesus explained to Nicodemus: &#x201C;Unless anyone is born from water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:5</a>) Jesus was apparently speaking of the water of baptism, when a person repents of his sins and turns away from his former course of life, presenting himself to God through baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 4:4, 5</a>, which speaks of the &#x201C;one baptism.&#x201D;The apostle John later wrote: &#x201C;This is he that came by means of water and blood, Jesus Christ .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. For there are three witness bearers, the spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in agreement.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 5:5-8</a>) When Jesus came &#x201C;into the world,&#x201D; that is, when he began his ministerial and sacrificial course as God&#x2019;s Messiah, he came to John the Baptizer to be immersed in water (not in repentance for sins, but in presentation of himself to God, to carry out God&#x2019;s will for him). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:5-7</a>) After this, God&#x2019;s spirit came down upon him, a testimony that he was God&#x2019;s Son and the Messiah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 3:21,&#xA0;22</a>) It is the water of his baptism that is in harmony with the blood of his sacrifice and with God&#x2019;s spirit in unanimously testifying to this great Messianic truth.<span id=\"page1174\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1174\" data-before-text=\"1174\"></span><strong><em>Other figurative uses. </em></strong>David said concerning the wicked: &#x201C;May they dissolve as into waters that go their way.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 58:7</a>) David may have had in mind the torrent valleys common in Palestine, many of which are filled with a swelling, threatening torrent during a flash flood. But the water quickly runs off and disappears, leaving the valley dry.When attacking the city of Ai, the Israelites sent out a small force that was defeated. This had a demoralizing effect on the Israelites, for the account says that the hearts of the people of Israel &#x201C;began to melt and became as water,&#x201D; meaning that they sensed they had somehow incurred Jehovah&#x2019;s displeasure and were without his help. Joshua was very upset, evidently because Israel, the army of Jehovah, had fled in fear before their enemies, thus bringing reproach upon Jehovah&#x2019;s name.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004582/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 7:5-9</a>."}
