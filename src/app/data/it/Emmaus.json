{"title":"Emmaus","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200001353","html":"<span id=\"page723\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"723\" data-before-text=\"723\"></span><strong>EMMAUS</strong>(Em&#xB7;ma&#x2B9;us).The village toward which Cleopas and a fellow disciple were journeying when they were joined by the materialized Jesus Christ on the day of his resurrection. It was not, however, until after they reached Emmaus and Jesus &#x201C;was reclining with them at the meal&#x201D; that they recognized him. Following Jesus&#x2019; subsequent disappearance the two disciples returned to Jerusalem that same evening. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001353/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 24:13-33</a>) Luke says that the village was &#x2018;sixty stadia&#x2019; (7.5 Roman miles [11&#xA0;km; 7&#xA0;mi]) from Jerusalem.However, the present location of Emmaus is uncertain, at least half a dozen different sites having been proposed. Most prominent among these is &#x2BD;Imwas on the road to Tel Aviv-Yafo. But &#x2BD;Imwas is about 175 stadia (32&#xA0;km; 20&#xA0;mi) WNW of that city, almost three times as far as Luke mentions. Another oft-proposed site, Qalunyah (Mevasseret Ziyyon), located on the main road to Tel Aviv-Yafo and accepted by some as the Ammaous referred to by Josephus, is about 35 stadia (6.5&#xA0;km; 4&#xA0;mi) from Jerusalem and so is too close to fit Luke&#x2019;s record. Some, therefore, prefer to identify Emmaus with El-Qubeiba, on a more northerly Roman road than the other suggested sites. Here remains have been found believed to date back to the Greek Scripture period. The location, about 60 stadia (11&#xA0;km; 7&#xA0;mi) NW of Jerusalem, lends support to the view that this may be the Biblical village. Nonetheless, any final identification is impossible at this time."}
