Jonathan, looking for a passage to cross over to attack the Philistine outpost, saw the two crags, one on the N facing Michmash (where the Philistines were encamped), the other on the S facing Geba. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000806/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 13:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000806/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 14:5</a>) Between these two cities the Wadi Suweinit (Nahal Mikhmas) descends toward the Jordan and becomes a deep gorge with nearly vertical cliffs somewhat to the E of the cities. The location of the two crags is considered to have been at the point where the wadi makes a sharp bend, though the precise identification of the crags is conjectural."}
