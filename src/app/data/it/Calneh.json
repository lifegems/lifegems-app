{"title":"Calneh","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000868","html":"<span id=\"page394\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"394\" data-before-text=\"394\"></span><strong>CALNEH</strong>(Cal&#x2B9;neh).<strong>1. </strong>A city founded by Nimrod in the land of Shinar. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000868/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:10</a>) It thus evidently lay in southern Mesopotamia, but the location is uncertain. Nippur, an ancient Babylonian city about 85&#xA0;km (50&#xA0;mi) SE of Babylon, has long been suggested as its site, based on Talmudic tradition and other factors. Some scholars, however, prefer an identification with Kulunu, the early name of a city of some importance near Babylon. A third possibility is a twin city of Kish called Hursagkalama, the latter part of the name (-kalama) supposedly representing Calneh. Some translations (<em>RS, JB, NE</em>) render Calneh, not as a place-name, but as the phrase &#x201C;all of them&#x201D; so that the text reads, &#x201C;Babel, Erech, and Accad, <em>all of them </em>in the land of Shinar.&#x201D; This, however, requires an adjustment in the vowel pointing of the Masoretic text.<strong>2. </strong>A place mentioned by the prophet Amos, along with the cities of Hamath and Gath, when warning the people of Israel and Judah of coming calamity. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000868/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Am 6:2</a>) While some commentators consider it to be the same as No.&#xA0;1 above, most scholars view its association with Hamath and Gath as indicating a location in the region adjacent to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, rather than in Mesopotamia. They suggest an identification with Kullani of the Assyrian inscriptions in <span id=\"page395\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"395\" data-before-text=\"395\"></span>northern Syria (apparently represented today by modern Kullan K&#xF6;y, about 16&#xA0;km [10&#xA0;mi] SE of Arpad), mentioned by Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III as among the places subjugated during an Assyrian campaign in the west. If this identification is correct, then Calneh here may be the same as Calno of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000868/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 10:9</a>."}
