(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000014/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 29:12</a>) Because of the similarity of their sons&#x2019; names, this Abdi and the one described above are represented in some Bible dictionaries as being the same person. However, the fact that this second Abdi&#x2019;s son, Kish, lived in the time of King Hezekiah some 250 years after David&#x2019;s time, makes such a conclusion illogical. This second Abdi was probably a contemporary of Kings Jotham and Ahaz, whose reigns cover the period from 777&#xA0;B.C.E. to about 746&#xA0;B.C.E.<strong>3. </strong>A man of the family of Elam who lived in postexilic times.
