Its exact location is unknown today. Some identify it with Khirbet es-Suyag, which perhaps derives its name from the Greek word <em>si&#xB7;a&#xB7;gon&#x2B9; </em>(jawbone), less than 3&#xA0;km (2&#xA0;mi) E of Beth-shemesh.At Lehi, Samson struck down a thousand Philistines with the moist jawbone of an ass. Subsequently he called the site Ramath-lehi (meaning &#x201C;Lofty Place of the Jawbone&#x201D;), probably to memorialize the victory Jehovah had given him there. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002716/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 15:9-19</a>) Originally, though, Lehi may have got its name from the shape of its crags.Later, according to the rendering of numerous translators, Shammah struck down many Philistines assembled at Lehi. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002716/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 23:11, 12</a>; <em>AT, JB, NW, RS</em>) However, the Hebrew term <em>la&#xB7;chai&#xB7;yah&#x2B9; </em>literally means &#x201C;into the tent village,&#x201D; and, by a slight change in vowel pointing, is rendered &#x201C;to Lehi.&#x201D;"}
