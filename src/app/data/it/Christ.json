In foretelling his birth, the angel instructed Joseph: &#x201C;You must call his name Jesus.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 1:21</a>) But when the shepherds near Bethlehem were given the angelic announcement, in anticipation of Jesus&#x2019; future role they were told: &#x201C;There was born to you today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord,&#x201D; that is, &#x201C;who <em>is to be </em>Christ the Lord.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:11</a>, ftn.The personal name of Jesus followed by the title Christ may call attention to the person himself and that he is the one who became the Anointed One of Jehovah. This occurred when he reached about 30 years of age, was baptized in water, and was anointed with Jehovah&#x2019;s spirit visibly observed in the form of a dove descending upon him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 3:13-17</a>) This is the point Peter made at Pentecost: &#x201C;God made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus,&#x201D; evidently recalling the expression he had heard from the lips of Jesus, who first used the term &#x201C;Jesus Christ.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:36-38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 17:3</a>) This expression &#x201C;Jesus Christ&#x201D; is also used in the opening words of the Christian Greek Scriptures.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 1:1</a>.On the other hand, putting the title ahead of the name and saying &#x201C;Christ Jesus&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Jesus Christ&#x201D; places greater emphasis on the office or position held by Jesus. It focuses attention primarily on the office, secondarily on the office holder, as in saying King David or Governor Zerubbabel. It would remind one of the singular official position Jesus holds as the Anointed One of Jehovah, an honored position not shared by others of his followers who are also anointed. Only Jehovah&#x2019;s beloved Son is entitled &#x201C;Christ Jesus.&#x201D; Paul used this expression in his first inspired letter. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 2:14</a>) Luke also used it, once, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 24:24</a> (<em>NW; RS</em>), when speaking about Paul&#x2019;s bearing witness.The use of the article &#x201C;the&#x201D; with the title (&#x201C;the Christ&#x201D;) is another way attention is sometimes drawn to the office as held by Jesus.

We never find a combination like the <em>Lord Christ </em>Jesus or the <em>King Christ </em>Jesus, but we do find the <em>Lord </em>Jesus <em>Christ. </em>The expression &#x201C;our Savior, Christ Jesus,&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Timothy 1:10</a>, in the Greek text has the expression &#x201C;of us&#x201D; between &#x201C;Savior&#x201D; and &#x201C;Christ&#x201D; to identify who the Savior is, in keeping with the expression &#x201C;Christ Jesus our Savior [literally, &#x201C;Christ Jesus the Savior of us&#x201D;].&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Tit 1:4</a>) In the text at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Timothy 2:5</a> mention is made of &#x201C;a man, Christ Jesus&#x201D; as the Mediator, but &#x201C;a man&#x201D; is not a title. The expression only explains that Christ Jesus was at one time a man on earth.An exceptional use of the title &#x201C;Christ&#x201D; is Paul&#x2019;s reference to Moses rather than Jesus, when he writes: &#x201C;He [Moses] esteemed the reproach of the Christ [<em>Khri&#xB7;stou&#x2B9;, </em>&#x201C;Anointed One&#x201D;] as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 11:26</a>) <span id=\"page439\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"439\" data-before-text=\"439\"></span>Moses was never anointed with any literal oil as were the high priests and kings of Israel.

So, in a similar sense Moses received a special appointment. Paul, therefore, could say of Moses that he was Jehovah&#x2019;s anointed one, or Christ, the recipient of a commission given to him at the burning bush, which appointment he considered to be greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000966/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 3:2&#x2013;4:17</a>.The term &#x201C;Christ&#x201D; is also used when speaking of the Christian congregation and its relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ. &#x201C;Now you are Christ&#x2019;s body, and members individually,&#x201D; in a spiritual sense.
