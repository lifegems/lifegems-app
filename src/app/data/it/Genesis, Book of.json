After <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 1:1, 2</a> (relating to the creation of the heavens and the earth), the book evidently covers a span of thousands of years involved in the preparation of the earth for human habitation (see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/0\">CREATION</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/1\">DAY</a>), and thereafter it covers the period from man&#x2019;s creation on down to the year 1657&#xA0;B.C.E., when Joseph died.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/2\">CHRONOLOGY</a> (From Human Creation to the Present).<strong>Writership. </strong>The objection once raised by some skeptics that writing was not known in Moses&#x2019; day is today generally discounted. In his book <em>New Discoveries in Babylonia About Genesis </em>(1949, p.&#xA0;35), P.&#xA0;J.&#xA0;Wiseman points out that archaeological research gives ample proof that &#x201C;the art of writing began in the earliest historical times known to man.&#x201D; Virtually all modern scholars acknowledge the existence of writing long before the time of Moses (in the second millennium B.C.E.). Expressions such as that found in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Exodus 17:14</a>, <em>&#x201C;Write </em>this as a memorial in the book,&#x201D; substantiate the fact that writing was in common use in Moses&#x2019; day. Adam must have had the ability to devise a form of writing, God having given him, as a perfect man, a language, with the ability to handle it perfectly, even to the extent of composing poetry.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:19,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>.<strong><em>From where did Moses get the information he included in Genesis?</em></strong>All the information contained in the book of Genesis relates to events that took place prior to Moses&#x2019; birth. It could have been received directly by divine revelation. It is obvious that someone had to receive the information relating to the events prior to man&#x2019;s creation in that way, whether Moses or someone prior to him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:1-27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:7,&#xA0;8</a>) This information and the remaining details, however, could have been transmitted to Moses by means of oral tradition. Because of the long life span of men of that period, the information could have been passed from Adam to Moses through just five human links, namely, Methuselah, Shem, Isaac, Levi, and Amram. A third possibility is that Moses obtained much of the information for Genesis from already existing writings or documents. As far back as the 18th&#xA0;century, the Dutch scholar Campegius Vitringa held this view, basing his conclusion upon the frequent occurrence in Genesis (ten times) of the expression (in <em>KJ</em>) &#x201C;these are the generations of,&#x201D; and once &#x201C;this is the book of the generations of.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 5:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 6:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/4\" data-bid=\"5-5\" class=\"b\"> 11:10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/5\" data-bid=\"5-6\" class=\"b\"> 27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/6\" data-bid=\"5-7\" class=\"b\"> 25:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/7\" data-bid=\"5-8\" class=\"b\"> 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/8\" data-bid=\"5-9\" class=\"b\"> 36:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/9\" data-bid=\"5-10\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4/10\" data-bid=\"5-11\" class=\"b\"> 37:2</a>) In this expression the Hebrew word for &#x201C;generations&#x201D; is <em>toh&#xB7;le&#xB7;dhohth&#x2B9;, </em>and it is better rendered &#x201C;histories&#x201D; or &#x201C;origins.&#x201D; For example, <em>&#x201C;generations </em>of the heavens and of the earth&#x201D; would hardly be fitting, whereas <em>&#x201C;history </em>of the heavens and the earth&#x201D; is meaningful. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:4</a>) In harmony with this, the German <em>Elberfelder, </em>the French <em>Crampon, </em>and the Spanish <em>Bover-Cantera </em>all use the term &#x201C;history,&#x201D; as does the <em>New World Translation. </em>There is no doubt that even as men today are interested in an accurate historical record, so they have been from the start.For these reasons, Vitringa and others since have understood each use of <em>toh&#xB7;le&#xB7;dhohth&#x2B9; </em>in Genesis to refer to an already existing written historical document that Moses had in his possession and that he relied upon for the majority of the information recorded in Genesis. They <span id=\"page920\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"920\" data-before-text=\"920\"></span>believe that the persons named in direct connection with such &#x2018;histories&#x2019; (Adam, Noah, Noah&#x2019;s sons, Shem, Terah, Ishmael, Isaac, Esau, and Jacob) were either the writers or original possessors of those written documents. This, of course, would still leave unexplained how all such documents came to be in the possession of Moses. It also leaves unexplained why documents obtained from men who were not distinguished as faithful worshipers of Jehovah (such as Ishmael and Esau) should be the source of much of the information used. It is entirely possible that the expression &#x201C;This is the history of&#x201D; is simply an introductory phrase serving conveniently to divide off the various sections of the long overall history. Compare Matthew&#x2019;s use of a similar expression to introduce his Gospel account.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 1:1</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/3\">WRITING</a>.No definite conclusion can be arrived at, therefore, as to the immediate source from which Moses obtained the information he recorded. Rather than just by one of the methods discussed, the information may have been received by all three, some through direct revelation, some through oral transmission, some by written records. The important point is that Jehovah God guided the prophet Moses so that he wrote by divine inspiration.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 1:21</a>.The material was to serve as an inspired guide to future generations.

On the basis of supposed differences of style and word usage, they have advanced the so-called documentary theory. According to this theory, there were three sources, which they call &#x201C;J&#x201D; (Jahwist), &#x201C;E&#x201D; (Elohist), and &#x201C;P&#x201D; (Priest Codex). Because of a double mention of a certain event or because of similarity of accounts in different parts of Genesis, some would add still further sources to the list, going so far in dissecting the book of Genesis as to claim that there were up to 14 independent sources. They contend that these various sources or writers held different views and theologies yet that, nevertheless, Genesis as an amalgamated product of these sources somehow forms a connected whole. There are many absurdities to which they go to support their theories, a few of which may be mentioned.The original basis for the documentary theory was the use of different titles for God; the critics claim that this indicates different writers. The unreasonableness of such a view, however, can be seen in that in just one small portion of Genesis we find the following titles: &#x201C;the Most High God&#x201D; (<em>&#x2BC;El &#x2BD;El&#xB7;yohn&#x2B9;, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:18</a>); &#x201C;Producer of heaven and earth&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">14:19</a>); &#x201C;Sovereign Lord&#x201D; (<em>&#x2BC;Adho&#xB7;nai&#x2B9;, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">15:2</a>); &#x201C;God of sight&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">16:13</a>); &#x201C;God Almighty&#x201D; (<em>&#x2BC;El Shad&#xB7;dai&#x2B9;, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">17:1</a>); &#x201C;God&#x201D; (<em>&#x2BC;Elo&#xB7;him&#x2B9;, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">17:3</a>); &#x201C;the true God&#x201D; (<em>ha&#xB7;&#x2BC;Elo&#xB7;him&#x2B9;, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">17:18</a>); &#x201C;the Judge of all the earth&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">18:25</a>). Trying to use this as a basis for attributing each of these sections to a different writer produces insurmountable difficulties and becomes absurd. Rather, the truth is that the different titles applied to God in Genesis are used because of their meaning, revealing Jehovah in his different attributes, in his various works, and in his dealings with his people.Other examples are: Because of the use of the word <em>ba&#xB7;ra&#x2BC;&#x2B9;, </em>&#x201C;created,&#x201D; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 1:1</a> is said to be written by the source called &#x201C;P.&#x201D; Yet we find the same word at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 6:7</a> in the source supposed to be &#x201C;J.&#x201D; The expression &#x201C;land of Canaan&#x201D; appearing in several texts (among which are <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 12:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 13:12a;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> 16:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/20/3\" data-bid=\"21-4\" class=\"b\"> 17:8</a>) is said to be a peculiarity of the writer known as &#x201C;P,&#x201D; and therefore these critics hold that &#x201C;P&#x201D; wrote these passages. But in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">chapters&#xA0;42,</a> <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">44,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\"> 47</a>, and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">50</a>, we find the same expression in the writings attributed by the same critics to &#x201C;J&#x201D; and &#x201C;E.&#x201D; Thus, while the critics claim that their theories are needed to account for supposed inconsistencies in Genesis, examination shows that the theories themselves are riddled with inconsistencies.If the material attributed to each theoretical source is extricated portion by portion, and sentence by sentence, from the Genesis account and then reassembled, the result is a number of accounts each one of which by itself is illogical and incoherent. If we were to believe that these various sources were used and put together by a later compiler, we would be forced to believe that these incoherent accounts, before being amalgamated, were accepted as historical and were used for centuries by the nation of Israel. But what writer, especially a historian, would even construct such disconnected narratives, and if he did, what nation would accept them as a history of its people?Illustrating the unreasonableness of the advocates of the &#x201C;documentary theory&#x201D; is this statement <span id=\"page921\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"921\" data-before-text=\"921\"></span>by Egyptologist K.&#xA0;A.&#xA0;Kitchen: &#x201C;In Pentateuchal criticism it has long been customary to divide the whole into separate documents or &#x2018;hands&#x2019;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. But the practice of Old Testament criticism in attributing these characteristics to different &#x2018;hands&#x2019; or documents becomes a manifest absurdity when applied to other ancient Oriental writings that display precisely similar phenomena.&#x201D; He then cites an example from an Egyptian biography that might, using the <span id=\"page922\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"922\" data-before-text=\"922\"></span>theoretical methods employed by the critics of Genesis, be attributed to different &#x201C;hands&#x201D; but which work the evidence shows &#x201C;was conceived, composed, written, and carved within months, weeks, or even less. There can be no &#x2018;hands&#x2019; behind its style, which merely varies with the subjects in view and the question of fitting treatment.&#x201D; (<em>The New Bible Dictionary, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Douglas, 1980, p.&#xA0;349) The weakness of the critics&#x2019; theories actually gives added strength to the evidence that only one man, Moses, recorded the connected, coherent account found in Genesis as inspired by God.<strong>The Historical Character of Genesis. </strong>Genesis is the only source known to humans that provides a logical, coherent history of things back to the beginning. Without its factual history of the first man and woman, we would be left with the fanciful stories or allegorical explanations of man&#x2019;s beginning that are found in the creation accounts of pagan nations. A comparison of the book of Genesis with the pagan creation accounts clearly demonstrates the superiority of the Bible account.Thus, the principal Babylonian myth says that the god Marduk, the chief god of Babylon, killed the goddess Tiamat, then took her corpse and &#x201C;split her like a shellfish into two parts: Half of her he set up and ceiled it as sky.&#x201D; So the earth and its sky came into existence. As to the creation of human life, this myth states that the gods caught the god Kingu and they &#x201C;imposed on him his guilt and severed his blood (vessels). Out of his blood they fashioned mankind.&#x201D; (<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>edited by James Pritchard, 1974, pp.&#xA0;67,&#xA0;68) Egyptian creation myths likewise involve the activities of several gods, but they disagree as to which city&#x2019;s god (that of Memphis or that of Thebes) was the one who conceived the creation. One Egyptian myth relates that the sun-god Ra created mankind from his tears. Greek myths parallel those of the Babylonians. Ancient Chinese records are mostly calendars and chronological calculations or records of merely local or temporary interest.Not one of such ancient sources furnishes us with the history, genealogy, and chronology that the book of Genesis provides. The writings of the ancient nations in general show uncertainty and confusion as to who their national founders were. The definiteness and detail with which Israel&#x2019;s early history is presented is strikingly different. In reality we should not expect it to be otherwise, in view of God&#x2019;s purpose toward his people. The Bible tells us that the nation of Israel was directly governed by God and that he dealt with their forefathers, especially Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Then he used Moses in a very special way, through him giving Israel the Law that established them as a nation. Israel&#x2019;s history is in recorded form not only for Israel&#x2019;s benefit but also for the benefit of all who will learn of the ways and dealings of the true God and serve him.In answering those who would reject many portions of Genesis as fables or folklore, Wilhelm M&#xF6;ller says: &#x201C;I do not think that it can be made plausible, that in any race fables and myths came in the course of time more and more to be accepted as actual facts, so that perchance we should now be willing to accept as historical truths the stories of the Nibelungenlied or Red Riding Hood. But this, according to the critics, must have been the case in Israel.&#x201D; (<em>The International Standard Bible Encyclop&#xE6;dia, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Orr, 1960, Vol.&#xA0;II, p.&#xA0;1209) He goes on to point out that the prophets accepted the account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah as correct (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 1:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> Am 4:11</a>) and that they accepted Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph as real persons. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 29:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> Mic 7:20</a>) Not only this, but in the Christian Greek Scriptures, Abraham is mentioned in many places, even by Jesus Christ at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 22:32</a>, in connection with the argument about the resurrection. If Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had not really lived, Jesus would have used another illustration.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 22:31-33</a>.<strong>Value of the Book. </strong>Genesis tells us how the universe came into being. In a matter-of-fact way it describes the wonders of creation, without making these overshadow the main purpose of the book. It is thus unlike the pagan creation stories that make these marvels the main thing and go to absurdities and obvious untruths to stress them. Genesis tells about the work of creation, and it shows God&#x2019;s purpose in creating man, the relationship of man to God, and the relationship of man to the animals. It gives us the reason for death and trouble experienced by mankind and the hope of deliverance. It points out that all humans descended from the one man Adam, who sinned and lost life for his posterity; it thereby enables us to understand how the ransom sacrifice of one man, Jesus Christ, could atone for the sins of mankind. Genesis enables us to see how the issue of the rightfulness of God&#x2019;s sovereignty was raised by the symbolic serpent, Satan the Devil. It gives the sure hope of destruction of Satan and of relief for mankind. It recounts the origin of Babylon and thus of all false <span id=\"page923\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"923\" data-before-text=\"923\"></span>religion in the post-Flood earth, thereby aiding in the identification of Babylon the Great in the book of Revelation.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/4\">BABYLON THE GREAT</a>.Jesus said that if anyone serves God, that one must worship Him with spirit and truth. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 4:24</a>) The Genesis account sets forth the truth of man&#x2019;s beginnings and of God&#x2019;s dealings with him. Since everything recorded in Genesis is true and not mythical, we are able to know the truth about man&#x2019;s history. We can see that up to the time of the Flood men certainly knew the truth of the Biblical account about Eden, for the garden was there and cherubs were there with the flaming sword at its gate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001650/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:24</a>) But those who wanted to go the way of their own desires ignored the facts that were before them. Noah, however, served God according to the way that man was originally created to serve him, according to <em>true </em>history. Although, following the Flood, Nimrod set up rebellion against God at the Tower of Babel, the patriarchs through the line of Shem continued to hold to the true way of life. When it was God&#x2019;s time to organize Israel into a nation and give them the Law, it did not come to them like something completely unknown, a revolutionary change in their way of life. No, for in the patriarchal society they had done many of the things that are found in the Law. As M&#x2019;Clintock and Strong&#x2019;s <em>Cyclop&#xE6;dia </em>(1881, Vol.&#xA0;III, p.&#xA0;782), declares: &#x201C;This theocracy cannot have entered into history without preparatory events. The facts which led to the introduction of the theocracy are contained in the accounts of Genesis.&#x201D;This, in turn, prepared the way for the Messiah and the introduction of Christianity. When Jesus Christ arrived, those who had been living according to the Law to the best of their ability were soon able to identify him. He did not appear suddenly and announce himself to be a great savior and leader without any background or historical credentials. The background that had been furnished right from Genesis on down enabled the honesthearted ones to recognize and follow him. Therefore a strong organization of Jewish Christians could be established as a nucleus, prepared to bring a convincing gospel message to the nations. The forefathers of the pagan nations had led them away from the truth.
