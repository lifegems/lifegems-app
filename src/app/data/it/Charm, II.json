The Hebrew word <em>che&#x2B9;ver </em>(rendered &#x2018;spell&#x2019;) refers to a magical formula spoken, sung, or written as a spell in order to &#x2018;bind&#x2019; a person.

Such spiritistic practices were among &#x201C;the detestable things&#x201D; that Jehovah forbade his people to indulge in.

The charmer is supposed to cast a spell over the serpent, often a hooded cobra, so it appears enchanted with the playing of music, usually on a flute or pipe instrument. Snakes are not deaf or hard of hearing, as some may think, but as <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 58:4, 5</a> implies, they are able to hear the voice of charmers as well as the music. One might think that it is a mere trick of training the snake as one would train an animal or bird, by placing it in a basket with a lid, playing soft music, quickly dropping the lid if any attempt is made to escape, until the snake finally learns to raise itself upright in obedience to the music without trying to escape. While this may be true in some instances, spiritistic forces are often apparently involved in snake charming.Attesting to the antiquity of this spiritistic practice is its mention in the Bible.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 58:4,&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Ec 10:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 3:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\"> Jer 8:17</a>."}
