Ungodly, violent humans and all those who were so indifferent that they refused to take note of God&#x2019;s warning were destroyed. The Flood was survived only by righteous Noah and his family, eight persons in all, along with a limited number of each kind of animal life, in a huge ark built at God&#x2019;s direction.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000758/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 7:1-24</a>.The fact that the Flood really occurred is verified by a number of Bible writers. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000758/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 54:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000758/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Pe 3:5,&#xA0;6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000758/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 11:7</a>) The strongest evidence, however, is the testimony of Jesus Christ himself, who was an eyewitness in the heavens. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000758/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 8:58</a>.) He pointedly said: &#x201C;In the days of Noah, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. the flood arrived and destroyed them all.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000758/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 17:26,&#xA0;27</a>.The account of the Flood is far more than a story. Jesus Christ indicated that it has prophetic significance. In his prophecy about &#x201C;the conclusion of the system of things,&#x201D; he made specific reference to &#x201C;the days of Noah.&#x201D; He pointed to the Flood as a warning example of a greater destruction to come during &#x201C;the presence of the Son of man.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000758/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000758/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 37-39</a>.<span id=\"page328\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"328\" data-before-text=\"328\"></span><strong>[Chart on page&#xA0;328]</strong>(For fully formatted text, see publication)<strong>Flood Legends</strong>Samples from six continents and the islands of the sea; hundreds of such legends are known<strong>Australia - Kurnai</strong>  Destruction by Water  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Babylon - Berossus&#x2019; account</strong>  Destruction by Water  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Babylon - Gilgamesh epic</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Bolivia - Chiriguano</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Borneo - Sea Dayak</strong>  Destruction by Water  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Burma - Singpho</strong>  Destruction by Water  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Canada - Cree</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Canada - Montagnais</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>China - Lolo</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Cuba - original natives</strong>  Destruction by Water  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>East Africa - Masai</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Egypt - Book of the Dead</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Fiji - Walavu-levu tradition</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>French Polynesia - Ra&#xEF;at&#xE9;a</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared<strong>Greece - Lucian&#x2019;s account</strong>  Destruction by Water  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Guyana - Macushi</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Iceland - Eddas</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>India - Andaman Islands</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>India - Bhil</strong>  Destruction by Water  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>India - Kamar</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Iran - Zend-Avesta</strong>  Destruction by Water  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared<strong>Italy - Ovid&#x2019;s poetry</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Malay Peninsula - Jakun</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Mexico - Codex Chimalpopoca</strong>  Destruction by Water  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Mexico - Huichol</strong>  Destruction by Water  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>New Zealand - Maori</strong>  Destruction by Water  Divine Cause  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>Peru - Indians of Huarochir&#xED;</strong>  Destruction by Water  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Animals Spared<strong>Russia - Vogul</strong>  Destruction by Water  Warning Given  Humans Spared  Preserved in a Vessel<strong>U.S.A.

Today there is about 1.4&#xA0;billion cu&#xA0;km (326&#xA0;million cu&#xA0;mi) of water on the earth. It covers more than 70&#xA0;percent of the globe&#x2019;s surface. The average depth of the oceans is 4&#xA0;km (2.5&#xA0;mi); average elevation of the land is only 0.8&#xA0;km (0.5&#xA0;mi) above sea level. If the earth&#x2019;s surface was smoothed out, it would all be covered with water to a depth of 2,400&#xA0;m (8,000&#xA0;ft)<strong>Water  </strong>c.&#xA0;70&#xA0;percent of earth&#x2019;s surface<strong>Land   </strong>c.&#xA0;30&#xA0;percent<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;327]</strong><strong>Could the Ark Have Held All the Animals?</strong>It is true that encyclopedias refer to over a million species of animals. But Noah was instructed to preserve only representatives of every &#x201C;kind&#x201D; of land animal and flying creature. Some investigators have said that just 43 &#x201C;kinds&#x201D; of mammals, 74 &#x201C;kinds&#x201D; of birds, and 10 &#x201C;kinds&#x201D; of reptiles could have produced the great variety of species of these creatures that are known today.
