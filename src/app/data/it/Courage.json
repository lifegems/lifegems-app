Jesus Christ told his disciples: &#x201C;In the world you are having tribulation, but take courage! I have conquered the world.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001049/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 16:33</a>) Never did the Son of God yield to the world&#x2019;s influence, but he triumphed over the world by not becoming like it in any respect.
