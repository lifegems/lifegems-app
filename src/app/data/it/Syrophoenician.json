Being a combination of &#x201C;Syrian&#x201D; and &#x201C;Phoenician,&#x201D; the expression &#x201C;Syrophoenician&#x201D; probably had its origin in the circumstance that Phoenicia was part of the Roman province of Syria. The Syrophoenician woman is also called <em>Kha&#xB7;na&#xB7;nai&#x2B9;a </em><span id=\"page1054\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1054\" data-before-text=\"1054\"></span>(literally, Canaanite; translated &#x201C;Phoenician&#x201D; in <em>NW</em>), for the early inhabitants of Phoenicia descended from Canaan, and in time, &#x201C;Canaan&#x201D; came to refer primarily to Phoenicia. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004286/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 15:22</a>, ftn) Her being termed &#x201C;Grecian&#x201D; likely means that she was of Greek descent.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004286/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 7:26</a>.Not long after Passover of 32&#xA0;C.E., this Syrophoenician woman approached Jesus Christ, repeatedly requesting that he expel a demon from her daughter. At first Jesus declined, saying: &#x201C;It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to little dogs.&#x201D; To the Jews dogs were unclean animals. But, in likening the non-Jews to &#x201C;little dogs,&#x201D; which might be kept in a home, and not to wild dogs of the street, Jesus softened the comparison. Nevertheless, what Jesus said apparently served to test the woman. Humbly, she acknowledged: &#x201C;Yes, Lord; but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.&#x201D; Her words reflected great faith, and therefore, her daughter was healed.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004286/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 15:21-28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004286/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 7:24-30</a>."}
