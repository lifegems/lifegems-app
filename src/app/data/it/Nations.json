Such a national group usually occupies a defined geographic territory and is subject to some form of central governmental control. According to the <em>Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, </em>&#x201C;Hebrew evidences a tendency for <em>goy </em>to describe a people in terms of its political and territorial affiliation, and so to approximate much more closely to our modern term &#x2018;nation.&#x2019; <em>&#x2BD;am </em>[people], conversely, always retains a strong emphasis on the element of consanguinity as the basis of union into a people.&#x201D; (Edited by G.&#xA0;J.&#xA0;Botterweck and H.&#xA0;Ringgren, Vol.&#xA0;2, 1975, p.&#xA0;427) The Greek terms <em>e&#x2B9;thnos </em>(nation) and <em>la&#xB7;os&#x2B9; </em>(people) are used similarly. In the Scriptures the plural forms of <em>gohy </em>and <em>e&#x2B9;thnos </em>usually refer to Gentile nations.<strong>Origin. </strong>The first notice of the forming of separate nations appears in the post-Flood period, in connection with the building of the Tower of Babel. Those sharing in this project were united in their opposition to God&#x2019;s purpose. The principal factor facilitating united action was that &#x201C;all the earth continued to be of one language and of one set of words.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003187/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:1-4</a>) Jehovah took notice of this and, by confusing their language, &#x201C;scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003187/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:5-9</a>; MAP Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;329.Separated now by communication barriers, each linguistic group developed its own culture, art, customs, traits, and religion<wbr>&#x2014;each its own ways of doing things.

Some nations were absorbed by their neighbors or disappeared altogether, because of weakness, disease, or war; others came into existence through new migrations and population increases. The spirit of nationalism at times became very strong among certain groups, and this, coupled with great military exploits, gave ambitious men the necessary thrust to build world empires at the expense of weaker nations.<strong>A Father of Nations. </strong>God told Abram to leave Ur and move to a land He would show him, for as He said, &#x201C;I shall make a great nation out of you.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003187/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 12:1-4</a>) Later, God enlarged on his promise, saying, &#x201C;You will certainly become a father of a crowd of nations. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.
