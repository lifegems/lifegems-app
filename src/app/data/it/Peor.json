(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">De 4:46</a>) However, this latter place is evidently a town, included as such in the territorial assignment of Reuben.

Both Peor and Beth-peor appear to be connected with the pagan worship of &#x201C;the Baal of Peor&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 25:1-3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 31:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> Jos 22:17</a>), and it is possible that the height of Peor was a center of such immoral worship.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/0\">BAAL</a> No.&#xA0;4; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/1\">BAAL OF PEOR</a>.Balaam was first taken to Bamoth-baal, then to &#x201C;the top of Pisgah,&#x201D; and finally to &#x201C;the top of Peor.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 22:41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 23:14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;28</a>) The direction of movement is from S to N and seems to indicate that Peor was N of Pisgah and Mount Nebo. Based on the testimony of Eusebius and Jerome, of the third and fourth centuries C.E., the summit of Peor is suggested to have been one of the peaks bordering the Wadi Husban.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003434/2\">BETH-PEOR</a>."}
