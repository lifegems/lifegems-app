It runs N until meeting the Mediterranean Sea at the town of el-&#x2BD;Arish (Rhinocolura), about 150&#xA0;km (90&#xA0;mi) E of Port Said. In the summer it is nothing more than a dry bed. During the rainy season, however, when numerous tributaries pour into it, the Wadi el-&#x2BD;Arish becomes a swollen torrent that tears at its banks, even uprooting trees and sweeping them down its turbulent course. This might allow for its identification as &#x201C;the <em>river </em>of Egypt&#x201D; in the boundary listing of the Promised Land at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001266/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 15:18</a>.<wbr>&#x2014;See, however, <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001266/0\">SHIHOR</a>."}
