Hophra is believed to have reigned for 19 years. However, according to Herodotus (II, 161), he reigned for 25 years.After the Jews fled to Egypt in 607&#xA0;B.C.E., Jehovah said by the mouth of Jeremiah: &#x201C;Here I am giving Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those seeking for his soul.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002070/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 44:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002070/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 26,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002070/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;30</a>) This was to be a sign of imminent calamity to come over the Jews dwelling in Egypt.

Hophra&#x2019;s troops revolted against him and set up Ahmose&#xA0;II (Amasis) as rival king. Even then, Hophra was so arrogant that he &#x201C;supposed that not even a god could depose him from his throne.&#x201D; However, he was taken prisoner and finally was killed by being strangled."}
