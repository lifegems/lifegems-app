One of the synonyms for love is &#x201C;devotion.&#x201D;Aside from those meanings, the Scriptures speak also of love guided by principle, as love of righteousness or even love for one&#x2019;s enemies, for whom a person may not have affection. This facet or expression of love is an unselfish devotion to righteousness and a sincere concern for the lasting welfare of others, along with an active expression of this for their good.The verb <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;hev&#x2B9; </em>or <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;hav&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;love&#x201D;) and the noun <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;havah&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;love&#x201D;) are the words primarily used in <span id=\"page274\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"274\" data-before-text=\"274\"></span>Hebrew to denote love in the foregoing senses, the context determining the sense and degree meant.The Christian Greek Scriptures mainly employ forms of the words <em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe, phi&#xB7;li&#x2B9;a, </em>and two words drawn from <em>stor&#xB7;ge&#x2B9; </em>(<em>e&#x2B9;ros, </em>love between the sexes, not being used). <em>A&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe </em>appears more frequently than the other terms.Of the noun <em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe </em>and the verb <em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pa&#x2B9;o, Vine&#x2019;s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words </em>says: &#x201C;Love can be known only from the actions it prompts. God&#x2019;s love is seen in the gift of His Son, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">I John 4:9,&#xA0;10</a>. But obviously this is not the love of complacency, or affection, that is, it was not drawn out by any excellency in its objects, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Rom. 5:8</a>. It was an exercise of the Divine will in deliberate choice, made without assignable cause save that which lies in the nature of God Himself, cp. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Deut. 7:7,&#xA0;8</a>.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;1981, Vol.&#xA0;3, p.&#xA0;21.Regarding the verb <em>phi&#xB7;le&#x2B9;o, </em>Vine comments: &#x201C;[It] is to be distinguished from <em>agapao </em>in this, that <em>phileo </em>more nearly represents tender affection. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Again, to love (<em>phileo</em>) life, from an undue desire to preserve it, forgetful of the real object of living, meets with the Lord&#x2019;s reproof, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">John 12:25</a>. On the contrary, to love life (<em>agapao</em>) as used in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">I Pet. 3:10</a>, is to consult the true interests of living. Here the word <em>phileo </em>would be quite inappropriate.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Vol.&#xA0;3, pp.&#xA0;21,&#xA0;22.James Strong&#x2019;s <em>Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, </em>in its Greek dictionary (1890, pp.&#xA0;75,&#xA0;76), remarks under <em>phi&#xB7;le&#x2B9;o: </em>&#x201C;To <em>be a friend to </em>(<em>fond of </em>[an individual or an object]), i.e. <em>have affection </em>for (denoting <em>personal </em>attachment, as a matter of sentiment or feeling; while [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pa&#x2B9;o</em>] is wider, embracing espec. the judgment and the <em>deliberate </em>assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty and propriety&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;).&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/0\">AFFECTION</a>.<em>A&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe, </em>therefore, carries the meaning of love guided, or governed, by principle. It may or may not include affection and fondness. That <em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe </em>may include affection and warmth is evident in many passages. At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">John 3:35</a>, Jesus said: &#x201C;The Father loves [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pai&#x2B9;</em>] the Son.&#x201D; At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">John 5:20</a>, he said: &#x201C;The Father has affection for [<em>phi&#xB7;lei&#x2B9;</em>] the Son.&#x201D; Certainly God&#x2019;s love for Jesus Christ is coupled with much affection. Also Jesus explained: &#x201C;He that loves [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pon&#x2B9;</em>] me will be loved [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pe&#xB7;the&#x2B9;se&#xB7;tai</em>] by my Father, and I will love [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pe&#x2B9;so</em>] him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:21</a>) This love of the Father and of the Son is accompanied by tender affection for such loving persons. Jehovah&#x2019;s worshipers must love him and his Son, as well as one another, in the same way.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 21:15-17</a>.So, although distinguished by respect for principle, <em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe </em>is not unfeeling; otherwise it would not differ from cold justice. But it is not ruled by feeling or sentiment; it never ignores principle. Christians rightly show <em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe </em>toward others for whom they may feel no affection or fondness, doing so for the welfare of those persons. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 6:10</a>) Yet, though not feeling affection, they do feel compassion and sincere concern for such fellow humans, to the limits and in the way that righteous principles allow and direct.However, while <em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe </em>refers to love governed by principle, there are good and bad principles. A wrong kind of <em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe </em>could be expressed, guided by bad principles. For example, Jesus said: &#x201C;If you love [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pa&#x2B9;te</em>] those loving you, of what credit is it to you? For even the sinners love those loving them. And if you do good to those doing good to you, really of what credit is it to you? Even the sinners do the same. Also, if you lend without interest to those from whom you hope to receive, of what credit is it to you? Even sinners lend without interest to sinners that they may get back as much.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 6:32-34</a>) The principle upon which such ones operate is: &#x2018;Do good to me and I will do good to you.&#x2019;The apostle Paul said of one who had worked alongside him: &#x201C;Demas has forsaken me because he loved [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pe&#x2B9;sas</em>] the present system of things.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 4:10</a>) Demas apparently loved the world on the principle that love of it will bring material benefits. Jesus says: &#x201C;Men have loved [<em>e&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pe&#xB7;san</em>] the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked. For he that practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, <em>in order that his works may not be reproved.&#x201D; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:19,&#xA0;20</a>) Because it is a truth or principle that darkness helps cover their wicked deeds, they love it.Jesus commanded: &#x201C;Love [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pa&#x2B9;te</em>] your enemies.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:44</a>) God himself established the principle, as the apostle Paul states: &#x201C;God recommends his own love [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pen</em>] to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. For if, when we were enemies, we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:8-10</a>) An outstanding instance of such love is God&#x2019;s dealing with Saul of Tarsus, who became the apostle Paul. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 9:1-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ti 1:15</a>) Loving our enemies, therefore, should be governed by the principle established by God and should be exercised in obedience to his commandments, whether or not such love is accompanied by any warmth or affection.<strong>God. </strong>The apostle John writes: &#x201C;God is love.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 4:8</a>) He is the very personification of love, which is his dominant quality. The converse is not <span id=\"page275\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"275\" data-before-text=\"275\"></span>true, however, that &#x2018;love (the abstract quality) is God.&#x2019; He reveals himself in the Bible as a <em>Person </em>and figuratively speaks of his &#x201C;eyes,&#x201D; &#x201C;hands,&#x201D; &#x201C;heart,&#x201D; &#x201C;soul,&#x201D; and so forth. He also has other attributes, among them justice, power, and wisdom. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">De 32:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> Job 36:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/17/2\" data-bid=\"18-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 7:12</a>) Moreover, he has the capacity to hate, a quality the very opposite of love. His love of righteousness requires his hatred of wickedness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">De 12:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 6:16</a>) Love includes the feeling and expression of warm personal affection, which only a <em>person </em>can have, or which can be extended toward a <em>person. </em>Certainly God&#x2019;s Son Jesus Christ is not an abstract quality; he spoke of being with his Father, working with him, pleasing him, and hearing him, as well as of angels beholding the face of his Father, things impossible with a mere abstract quality.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 5:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/19/3\" data-bid=\"20-4\" class=\"b\"> 6:46;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/19/4\" data-bid=\"20-5\" class=\"b\"> 8:28, 29,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/19/5\" data-bid=\"20-6\" class=\"b\"> 40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/19/6\" data-bid=\"20-7\" class=\"b\"> 17:5</a>.<strong><em>Evidence of his love. </em></strong>The evidence that Jehovah the Creator and God of the universe is love is abundant. This can be seen in the physical creation itself. With what remarkable care it has been made for the health, pleasure, and welfare of man! Man is made not just to exist but to enjoy eating, to delight in viewing the color and beauty of creation, to enjoy animals as well as the company of his fellowmen, and to find pleasure in the countless other delights of living.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:45</a>) He spares nothing that is for their good, no matter what it costs him; his love transcends anything that we can feel or express.

That was the giving of the life of his own faithful, only-begotten Son. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:16</a>) As the apostle John writes: &#x201C;As for us, we love, because he first loved us.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 4:19</a>) He is, accordingly, the Source of love. John&#x2019;s fellow apostle, Paul, writes: &#x201C;For hardly will anyone die for a righteous man; indeed, for the good man, perhaps, someone even dares to die. But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:7,&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Jo 4:10</a>.<strong><em>God&#x2019;s everlasting love. </em></strong>Jehovah&#x2019;s love for his faithful servants is everlasting; it does not fail or diminish, no matter in what circumstances, high or low, his servants may be, or what things, great or small, may come against them. The apostle Paul exclaimed: &#x201C;For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God&#x2019;s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:38,&#xA0;39</a>.<strong><em>God&#x2019;s sovereignty based on love. </em></strong>Jehovah glories in the fact that his sovereignty and the support of it by his creatures is based primarily on love. He desires only those who love his sovereignty because of his fine qualities and because it is righteous, who prefer his sovereignty to any other. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 2:9</a>) They choose to serve under his sovereignty rather than try to be independent<wbr>&#x2014;this because of their knowledge of him and of his love, justice, and wisdom, which they realize far surpasses their own. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 84:10,&#xA0;11</a>) The Devil failed in this respect, egotistically seeking independence for himself, as did Adam and Eve. In fact, the Devil challenged God&#x2019;s way of ruling, saying, in effect, that it was unloving, unrighteous (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:1-5</a>), and that God&#x2019;s creatures served Him not because of love, but through selfishness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:8-12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/32/1\" data-bid=\"33-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:3-5</a>.Jehovah God allowed the Devil to live and to put his servants, even his only-begotten Son, to the test, to the point of death.

Because of love. Jehovah knew his Son and knew the love his Son had for Him and for righteousness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 1:9</a>) He knew his Son most intimately and thoroughly. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 11:27</a>) He had full trust and confidence in the Son&#x2019;s faithfulness. More than that, &#x201C;love .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. is a perfect bond of union.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Col 3:14</a>) It is the most powerful bond in the universe, perfect love bonding the Son and the Father together unbreakably. For like reasons, God could trust his organization of servants, knowing that love would hold most of them immovably to him under test and that his organization of creatures would never secede in toto.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 110:3</a>.<strong>Jesus Christ. </strong>Because for untold ages Jesus associated most closely with his Father, the Source of love, and knew Him most intimately and thoroughly, he could say: &#x201C;He that has seen me has seen the Father also.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 11:27</a>) Therefore Jesus&#x2019; love is complete, perfect.

Jesus&#x2019; life and death exemplified the love this new commandment called for. In addition to doing good when the occasion arises, the follower of Christ is to take the initiative, under Christ&#x2019;s direction, to help others spiritually and otherwise. He is to work actively for their good. The preaching and teaching of the good news to others, some of whom may be enemies, is one of the greatest expressions of love, for it can result in everlasting life to them. The Christian must &#x2018;impart not only the good news of God but also his own soul&#x2019; in helping and working with those who accept the good news. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 2:8</a>) And he should be ready to surrender his soul (life) in behalf of them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 3:16</a>.<strong>How One Acquires Love. </strong>Through holy spirit, the first man and woman were created with a measure of this dominant attribute of God, namely love, and with the capacity to extend, enlarge, and enrich that love. Love is a fruit of God&#x2019;s spirit. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 5:22</a>) Godly love is not a quality that one has without knowing why, as may be the case with certain physical or mental abilities, such as physical beauty, talent in music, or similar inherited qualities. Godly love cannot exist in the person apart from knowledge and service of God or apart from meditation and appreciation. Only by cultivating love can one become an imitator of God, the Source of love. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 77:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> Eph 5:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/46/2\" data-bid=\"47-3\" class=\"b\"> Ro 12:2</a>) Adam failed to cultivate love of God; he did not progress toward perfection of love. This is shown by his not being in union with God, bound to God by that perfect bond of union. Adam, nevertheless, even though imperfect and sinful, passed on to his offspring, &#x201C;in his image,&#x201D; the ability and capacity to love. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 5:3</a>) Humankind in general expresses love, but it is often a misguided, deteriorated, twisted love.<strong><em>Love can be misguided. </em></strong>For these reasons, it is evident that a person can have real, properly directed love only by seeking and following God&#x2019;s spirit and the knowledge that comes from His Word. For example, a parent may have affection for his child. But he may let that love deteriorate or he may be misguided because of sentimentality, giving the child everything and denying him nothing. He may not exercise his parental authority in giving discipline and at times actual chastisement. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 22:15</a>) Such supposed love may actually be family pride, which is selfishness. The Bible says such a person is exercising, not love, but hate, because he is not taking the course that will save his child&#x2019;s life.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 13:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/49/1\" data-bid=\"50-2\" class=\"b\"> 23:13,&#xA0;14</a>.This is not the love that comes from God.

Furthermore, we used to have fathers who were of our flesh to discipline us, and we used to give them respect. Shall we not much more subject ourselves to the Father of our spiritual life and live? For they for a few days used to discipline us according to what seemed good to them, but he does so for our profit that we may partake of his holiness. True, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 12:7-11</a>.<strong><em>Knowledge gives love right direction. </em></strong>Love must be directed <em>first </em>to God, above all others. Otherwise it will become misdirected and even lead into the worship of a creature or thing. Knowing God&#x2019;s purposes is essential, because a person knows then what is best for his own welfare and that of others and will know how to express love in the proper way. Our love for God is to be with our &#x2018;whole heart, mind, soul, and strength.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 22:36-38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/54/1\" data-bid=\"55-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 12:29,&#xA0;30</a>) It is to be, not merely an outward expression, but a love that reflects the total inner person. Love involves the emotions. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:22</a>) But if the mind is not equipped with knowledge of what true love is and how it acts, love can be expressed in the wrong direction.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 4:7</a>) In harmony with this, and since love is the most important quality, dedication to God is to the <em>person </em>of Jehovah himself (in whom love is the dominant quality) and is not to a work or a cause. Then, love must be carried out with the soul, every fiber of one&#x2019;s organism; and all one&#x2019;s strength must be put behind that effort.<strong><em>Love is expansive. </em></strong>The true love that is a fruit of God&#x2019;s spirit is expansive.

It is easier to tell how it acts. In the following discussion of this fine quality, its application to Christians will be considered. The apostle Paul, in writing on the subject, first emphasizes how essential it is for a Christian believer and then details how it acts unselfishly: &#x201C;Love is long-suffering and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/69/0\" data-bid=\"70-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 13:4-7</a>.<em>&#x201C;Love is long-suffering and kind.&#x201D; </em>It puts up with unfavorable conditions and wrong actions of others, doing so with a purpose, namely, to work out the eventual salvation of those doing wrong or of others involved in the circumstances, as well as to vindicate, finally, Jehovah&#x2019;s sovereignty. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/70/0\" data-bid=\"71-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 3:15</a>) Love is kind, no matter what the provocation may be. Roughness or harshness on the part of a Christian toward others would not accomplish any good. Nonetheless, love can be firm and act in justice in behalf of righteousness. Those having authority may discipline wrongdoers, but even then, they are to employ kindness. Unkindness would bring benefit neither to the unkind counselor nor to the one doing unrighteousness, but it could separate that one even farther from repentance and right works.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/71/0\" data-bid=\"72-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 2:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/71/1\" data-bid=\"72-2\" class=\"b\"> Eph 4:32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002781/71/2\" data-bid=\"72-3\" class=\"b\"> Tit 3:4,&#xA0;5</a>.<em>&#x201C;Love is not jealous.&#x201D; </em>It is not envious of good things coming to others.

This sincere concern for others is one of the strongest motivating forces in love as well as one of the most effective and beneficial in its results. The possessor of love does not demand that everything be done <em>his </em>way. Paul said: &#x201C;To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.

Such an action would not be an expression of love for the individual. It might gain the favor of the corrected one, but it would harm rather than help him.<em>Love &#x201C;bears all things.&#x201D; </em>It is willing to endure, to suffer for righteousness&#x2019; sake. A literal rendering is, &#x201C;all things it is covering.&#x201D; (<em>Int</em>) A person having love will be slow to expose to others the one who wrongs him.
