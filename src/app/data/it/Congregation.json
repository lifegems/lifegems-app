A remnant of that congregation became part of Jesus&#x2019; congregation.<strong>Organization of the Christian Congregation. </strong>While Christian congregations of God were established in various places, they did not function independently of one another. Instead, they all recognized the authority of the Christian governing <span id=\"page499\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"499\" data-before-text=\"499\"></span>body at Jerusalem. This governing body was comprised of the apostles and older men of the Jerusalem congregation, there being no rival bodies elsewhere seeking to supervise the congregation. It was to the faithful Christian governing body of the first century C.E. that the issue of circumcision was submitted for consideration. When the governing body made its decision, as directed by the holy spirit, that decision was accepted and became binding upon all Christian congregations, these willingly submitting to it.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001021/81/0\" data-bid=\"82-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 15:22-31</a>.The Christian body in Jerusalem sent out traveling representatives. Thus, Paul and others delivered the governing body&#x2019;s decision just mentioned, it being stated: &#x201C;Now as they traveled on through the cities they would deliver to those there for observance the decrees that had been decided upon by the apostles and older men who were in Jerusalem.&#x201D; Concerning the effects produced, it is said: &#x201C;Therefore, indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number from day to day.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001021/82/0\" data-bid=\"83-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 16:4,&#xA0;5</a>) Earlier, when the apostles in Jerusalem &#x201C;heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they dispatched Peter and John to them; and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001021/83/0\" data-bid=\"84-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 8:14,&#xA0;15</a>.The individual congregations adhered closely to the direction of the Christian governing body, which supervised the appointment of older men.
