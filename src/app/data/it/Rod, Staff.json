God used the nations around Israel, such as Assyria, to execute punishment on Israel for her sins, and in this action those nations were as a rod of punishment, or chastisement, under God&#x2019;s authority or allowance. Yet these nations acted, not out of love for Jehovah or hate for the sins of Israel, but out of animosity toward both God and Israel, and they went beyond their commission and enjoyed heaping additional afflictions upon Israel. Besides that, these powers, especially Assyria and Babylon, lifted themselves up in haughtiness against Jehovah God himself. God said of Assyria by means of his prophet Isaiah: &#x201C;Aha, the Assyrian, the rod for my anger,&#x201D; but he also described Assyria&#x2019;s haughtiness, saying: &#x201C;Will the ax enhance itself over the one chopping with it, or the saw magnify itself over the one moving it back and forth, as though the staff moved back and forth the ones raising it on high, as though the rod raised on high the one who is not wood?&#x201D; Then He foretold punishment to come upon the nation of Assyria for thus thinking that it was greater than the One using it and for lifting itself up against Him.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 10:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/26/1\" data-bid=\"27-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;15</a>.When Jehovah made a covenant for the kingdom with David, he said of the line of kings of David&#x2019;s dynasty: &#x201C;I myself shall become his father, and he himself will become my son.

When Jesus Christ was brought before the Jewish high court and before the Roman governor Pilate, he was afflicted, mocked, spit upon, beaten, and finally killed. The Jewish leaders first used their authority against Jesus and then made the &#x201C;rod&#x201D; heavier by turning him over to the Roman government for execution. The prophet Micah foretold such affliction in these words: &#x201C;With the rod they will strike upon the cheek the judge of Israel.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 5:1</a>) After Jesus&#x2019; death and resurrection, the Jewish rulers used their authority to persecute Jesus&#x2019; followers, and in many instances Rome and the other governments of earth likewise used their rod of authority in a wrong way. For this they would be brought to account by God.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:8-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/31/1\" data-bid=\"32-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Th 1:6-9</a>.<strong><em>Parental authority. </em></strong>&#x201C;Rod&#x201D; is used also to symbolize the authority of parents over their children. The book of Proverbs makes many references to this authority, the term symbolizing all forms of discipline used, including the literal rod used for chastisement. The parent is actually responsible before God to exercise this rod, controlling the child. If the parent fails in this, he will bring ruination and death to his child and disgrace and God&#x2019;s disapproval to himself also.
