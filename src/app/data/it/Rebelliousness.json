Pride, selfishness, outside pressures, disagreement with the judgment of a superior, and a desire to get out from under subjection or oppression, either real or imagined, have been among the leading causes for rebellion.<strong>Early History. </strong>Rebellion against God had its start in the invisible realm. By means of a serpent, a spirit creature, who later became known as Satan the Devil, endeavored to get the first woman Eve to rebel against her Creator. He made rebellion attractive, presenting it as a course that would lead to enlightenment. Eve gave in to the selfish ambition to &#x201C;be like God,&#x201D; in the sense of determining for herself what was good and what was bad instead of abiding by God&#x2019;s judgment on this matter. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/0\">TREES</a> [Figurative Use].) Imagining herself to be deprived of something that she had now come to view as rightfully belonging to her, Eve chose to transgress God&#x2019;s command. Later her husband Adam yielded to her pressure and joined in this rebellion. He did so, not because he was deceived into thinking that the serpent was <span id=\"page758\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"758\" data-before-text=\"758\"></span>speaking the truth, but evidently because he selfishly chose the companionship of his sinful wife in preference to the approval of God.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:1-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ti 2:14</a>.For centuries afterward it appears that the majority of mankind did not want to submit themselves to God. From the time of Abel&#x2019;s death until the birth of Noah, a period of more than 926 years, only Enoch is specifically mentioned as one who walked with God. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 5:22</a>) Rebelliousness also continued to spread in the heavenly realm. In Noah&#x2019;s day, angels, desiring sensual pleasure, disobediently forsook their heavenly posts, materialized human bodies, married women, and fathered offspring.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 6:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 3:19, 20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Pe 2:4,&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> Jude&#xA0;6</a>.By Noah&#x2019;s time the spirit of rebelliousness had so saturated mankind that Jehovah God saw fit to destroy the human race by means of a flood. Only Noah and his immediate family, eight persons all together, were found worthy of preservation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 6:5-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 7:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003659/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>.<strong>In Israel. </strong>Years later Jehovah God began to deal exclusively with the nation of Israel. Yet throughout Israel&#x2019;s history there were numerous cases of rebellion against Jehovah and against his representatives, on a national, group, or individual level. In certain cases those who rebelled were not constantly rebellious persons. For example, Moses and Aaron faithfully served Jehovah God for many years. However, when subjected to the pressure of quarreling Israelites on one occasion, they lost self-control and rebelliously failed to give glory to God for a miraculous provision of water.
