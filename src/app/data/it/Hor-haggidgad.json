As discussed under the heading <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002076/0\">BENE-JAAKAN</a>, a comparison of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002076/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Numbers 33:31-33</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002076/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 10:6, 7</a> seems to indicate that the Israelites passed through this same region twice, Hor-haggidgad being called &#x201C;Gudgodah&#x201D; on the later trip. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002076/1\">GUDGODAH</a>.) The exact location cannot be determined with certainty. Most scholars, however, tentatively identify Hor-haggidgad (Gudgodah) with a site on the Wadi Khadakhid, about 65&#xA0;km (40&#xA0;mi) NNW of the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba."}
