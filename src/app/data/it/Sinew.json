Man is said to be woven together with bones and sinews.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004136/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 10:11</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004136/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job 40:15-18</a>.During Jacob&#x2019;s grappling with an angel, the angel touched the socket of Jacob&#x2019;s thigh joint, causing it to get out of place. The account written later by Moses says: &#x201C;That is why the sons of Israel are not accustomed to eat the sinew of the thigh nerve, which is on the socket of the thigh joint, down to this [Moses&#x2019;] day, because he touched the socket of Jacob&#x2019;s thigh joint by the sinew of the thigh nerve.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004136/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 32:32</a>) Many Jews still adhere to this custom, removing the sciatic nerve together with arteries and tendons before eating the animal. This precept is considered by some Jewish commentators a reminder of God&#x2019;s providence to Israel as exemplified in the experience of the patriarch Jacob, father of the 12 tribes.<strong>Figurative Use. </strong>In a figurative sense the Israelites were said to have a neck as &#x201C;an iron sinew,&#x201D; meaning that they were rigid, stubborn, stiff-necked.

God&#x2019;s spiritual revival of his people was pictured by the bringing together of bones and the putting of flesh and sinews upon them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004136/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 37:6-8</a>."}
