Eleazar was of the family of Kohath the son of Levi.

Being of the tribe of Levi, he was not included in God&#x2019;s condemnation expressed against the other 12 tribes, that none of them from 20 years old upward would enter the Promised Land, with the exception of Joshua and Caleb. Levi had no representative among the 12 spies, 10 of whom brought back bad reports, and the Levites apparently were not included in the faithless, rebellious murmuring against Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 13:4-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 14:26-30</a>.Shortly after the dedication of the tabernacle and the consecration of Aaron and his sons for the priesthood (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Le&#xA0;8</a>), Nadab and Abihu offered up illegitimate fire to Jehovah and were killed by fire proceeding from Jehovah.

With the division of duties in the care of the sanctuary, Eleazar had oversight of the tabernacle with its utensils, constant grain offering, oil, and incense. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 4:16</a>) At Jehovah&#x2019;s command Eleazar took up the copper fire holders that Korah and the others associated with him (none of whom were priests) had used to offer up incense to Jehovah in a desire to take over priestly duties. These were made into thin metal plates with which the altar was overlaid. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 16:37-40</a>) Eleazar officiated at the sin offering of the red heifer that provided the ashes for cleansing from certain uncleannesses.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 19:2, 3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 9:13</a>.After the Israelites went to war to punish the Midianites for the affair of Peor, Eleazar was on hand to aid in dividing the spoils taken from the Midianites and to declare God&#x2019;s statute regarding the things taken.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 31:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 21-41</a>.Phinehas, Eleazar&#x2019;s son by one of the daughters of Putiel, was rewarded by Jehovah with a covenant of peace for his zealous action in behalf of pure worship at the time Israel sinned in connection with the Baal of Peor. This may be considered as added to the covenant for the priesthood Jehovah had made with the tribe of Levi.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 25:1-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> Ex 6:25</a>.<strong>Becomes High Priest. </strong>In the 40th year of the wilderness journey, upon Aaron&#x2019;s death at the age of 123 years, Eleazar, then about 70 years of age, became high priest. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 33:37-39</a>) Eleazar, therefore, was the first high priest of Israel to officiate in the Promised Land when they entered about eight months later.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 27:18-23</a>) Eleazar also worked together with Joshua in the distribution of the Promised Land after the conquest of Canaan.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 14:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:1-3</a>.<strong>Head of Major Priestly House. </strong>The time of Eleazar&#x2019;s death is not stated in the Scriptures with exactness, but it seems to have been near the time of the death of Joshua. Eleazar was succeeded by his son Phinehas.

Jewish tradition holds that during the time the tabernacle was in Shiloh, there were 16 courses of priests, 8 in the family of Eleazar and 8 in that of his brother Ithamar. However, in David&#x2019;s time there were more chief men in the family of Eleazar than of Ithamar. Therefore David made 16 priestly divisions of the house of Eleazar and 8 of the house of Ithamar, making a total of 24 divisions that served in turn later at the temple.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 24:1-4</a>.<strong>2. </strong>The son of Abinadab who was sanctified to guard the sacred Ark that was brought to the <span id=\"page706\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"706\" data-before-text=\"706\"></span>house of his father in the city of Kiriath-jearim, after its return by the Philistines.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 7:1,&#xA0;2</a>.<strong>3. </strong>Son of Dodo the Ahohite; one of David&#x2019;s three outstanding mighty men. At Pas-dammim, during a military campaign with David, Eleazar distinguished himself by taking his stand in a field full of barley and single-handedly striking down the Philistines, &#x201C;so that Jehovah saved with a great salvation.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 11:12-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001287/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 23:9,&#xA0;10</a>.<strong>4. </strong>Son of Mahli the Merarite of the tribe of Levi.
