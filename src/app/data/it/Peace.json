Pointing forward to this was the angelic announcement made to shepherds at Jesus&#x2019; birth: <span id=\"page592\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"592\" data-before-text=\"592\"></span>&#x201C;Upon earth peace among men of goodwill.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:14</a>.The peaceful message proclaimed by Jesus and his followers appealed to &#x2018;friends of peace,&#x2019; that is, to persons desiring to be reconciled to God.

(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 1:79;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/31/1\" data-bid=\"32-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:3-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/31/2\" data-bid=\"32-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 1:29-34</a>.)

Jesus&#x2019; death as a ransom sacrifice cared for this need. As had been foretold: &#x201C;The chastisement meant for our peace was upon him, and because of his wounds there has been a healing for us.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 53:5</a>) Jesus&#x2019; sacrificial death on the torture stake also provided the basis for canceling the Mosaic Law, which divided the Jews from the non-Jews. Therefore, upon becoming Christians, both peoples could be at peace with God and with one another. The apostle Paul wrote: &#x201C;[Jesus] is our peace, he who made the two parties one and destroyed the wall in between that fenced them off. By means of his flesh he abolished the enmity, the Law of commandments consisting in decrees, that he might create the two peoples in union with himself into one new man and make peace; and that he might fully reconcile both peoples in one body to God through the torture stake, because he had killed off the enmity by means of himself. And he came and declared the good news of peace to you, the ones far off, and peace to those near, because through him we, both peoples, have the approach to the Father by one spirit.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 2:14-18</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 2:10, 11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/35/1\" data-bid=\"36-2\" class=\"b\"> Col 1:20-23</a>.&#x201C;The peace of God,&#x201D; that is the calmness and tranquillity that result from a Christian&#x2019;s precious relationship with Jehovah God, guards his heart and mental powers from becoming anxious about his needs. He has the assurance that Jehovah God provides for his servants and answers their prayers. This puts his heart and mind at rest. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Php 4:6,&#xA0;7</a>) Similarly, the peace that Jesus Christ gave to his disciples, based on their faith in him as God&#x2019;s Son, served to calm their hearts and minds. Although Jesus told them that the time was coming when he would no longer be with them personally, they had no reason to be concerned or to give way to fear. He was not leaving them without help but promised to send them the holy spirit.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:26, 27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:33</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Col 3:15</a>.The peace that Christians enjoyed was not to be taken for granted.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 5:13</a>) To preserve peace among themselves, they had to exercise care so as not to stumble fellow believers.

Regarding Solomon&#x2019;s reign, the Bible reports: &#x201C;Peace itself became his in every region of his, all around. And Judah and Israel continued to dwell in security, everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree, from Dan to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:24, 25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/52/1\" data-bid=\"53-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 22:9</a>) As is evident from other scriptures (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 72:7,&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/53/1\" data-bid=\"54-2\" class=\"b\"> Mic 4:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/53/2\" data-bid=\"54-3\" class=\"b\"> Zec 9:9, 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/53/3\" data-bid=\"54-4\" class=\"b\"> Mt 21:4,&#xA0;5</a>), this served as a pattern of what would take place under the rule of Christ Jesus, the One greater than Solomon, which name comes from a root meaning &#x201C;peace.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:42</a>.<strong>Peace Between Man and Animals. </strong>Jehovah God promised to the Israelites, if obedient: &#x201C;I will put peace in the land, and you will indeed lie down, with no one making you tremble; and I will make the injurious wild beast cease out of the land.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Le 26:6</a>) This meant that the wild animals would stay within the confines of their habitat and not bring harm to the Israelites and their domestic animals. On the other hand, if the Israelites proved to be disobedient, Jehovah would allow their land to be invaded and devastated by foreign armies. As this would result in reducing the population, wild animals would multiply, penetrate formerly inhabited areas, and do injury to the survivors and their domestic animals.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 23:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/56/1\" data-bid=\"57-2\" class=\"b\"> Le 26:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/56/2\" data-bid=\"57-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 17:5, 6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/56/3\" data-bid=\"57-4\" class=\"b\"> 24-26</a>.The peace promised to the Israelites in connection with the wild animals differed from that enjoyed by the first man and woman in the garden of Eden, for Adam and Eve enjoyed full dominion over the animal creation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:28</a>) By contrast, in prophecy, like dominion is attributed only to Christ Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 8:4-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/58/1\" data-bid=\"59-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 2:5-9</a>) Therefore, it is under the government of Jesus Christ, &#x201C;a twig out of the stump of Jesse,&#x201D; or God&#x2019;s &#x201C;servant David,&#x201D; that peace will again prevail between men and the animals. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 11:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/59/1\" data-bid=\"60-2\" class=\"b\"> 6-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/59/2\" data-bid=\"60-3\" class=\"b\"> 65:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003409/59/3\" data-bid=\"60-4\" class=\"b\"> Eze 34:23-25</a>) These last cited texts have a figurative application, for it is obvious that the peace between animals, such as the wolf and the lamb, there described did not find literal fulfillment in ancient Israel. It was thus foretold that persons of harmful, beastlike disposition would cease their vicious ways and live in peace with their more docile neighbors. However, the prophetic use of the animals figuratively to portray the peaceful conditions to prevail among God&#x2019;s people implies that there will also be peace among literal animals under the rule of Christ Jesus, even as there evidently was in Eden."}
