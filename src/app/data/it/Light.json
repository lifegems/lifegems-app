To this day, however, man still cannot give a complete answer to the question propounded over three millenniums ago by the Creator of light: &#x201C;Where, now, is the way by which the light distributes itself?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002742/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Job 38:24</a>.Light from the sun is a combination of colors, with each color having a different wavelength. The color of an object is determined by the particular portion of the light reflected by its surface. Thus light furnishes the many hues that delight the eye of man. It is also essential for earthly life<wbr>&#x2014;plant, animal, and human&#x2014;<wbr>to continue.<strong>The Source of Light. </strong>Jehovah God is the Former of light and the Creator of darkness.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002742/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:1</a>) So the bringing of light into existence with reference to the earth apparently involved gradually removing whatever had formerly obstructed the sun&#x2019;s rays from reaching this planet.
