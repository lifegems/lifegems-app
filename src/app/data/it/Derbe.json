At Derbe, he and Barnabas &#x2018;declared the good news&#x2019; and made &#x201C;quite a few disciples,&#x201D; including, possibly, &#x201C;Gaius of Derbe,&#x201D; who is later mentioned as a traveling companion of the apostle. While secular history indicates that after 41&#xA0;C.E. Derbe was the easternmost city of the <em>political </em>province of Galatia, Luke&#x2019;s description of it in this account as a &#x2018;city of Lycaonia&#x2019; is apparently in a regional or ethnographic sense.
