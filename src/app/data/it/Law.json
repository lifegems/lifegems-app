They had voluntarily gone into Egypt during Jacob&#x2019;s lifetime but were enslaved after Jacob&#x2019;s son, the prime minister Joseph, had died. So, in effect, they were sold into slavery for nothing. Jehovah, in harmony with the patriarchal law of redemption and of the priority of the firstborn son, told Pharaoh, by the mouth of Moses and Aaron: &#x201C;Israel is my son, my firstborn. And I say to you: Send my son away that he may serve me. But should you refuse to send him away, here I am killing your son, your firstborn.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002694/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 4:22,&#xA0;23</a>) No redemption price was necessary for this release, nor was any given to Egypt.

The enslavement had been unjust, so evidently Jehovah was seeing to it that they were now given wages for their labor.The family was held responsible for violations of law by individual members. The patriarchal head was the responsible representative; he was blamed for wrongs of his family and was required to punish individual wrongdoers in the family.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002694/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 31:30-32</a>.<strong><em>Marriage and birthright. </em></strong>Parents governed the arrangement of marriage for their sons and daughters.

When Jehovah gave Abraham the promise of receiving the land of Canaan, Abraham was first told to look in all four directions. Abraham did not say, &#x201C;I see,&#x201D; perhaps because God said that he would give the Promised Land to Abraham&#x2019;s <em>seed, </em>later on.
