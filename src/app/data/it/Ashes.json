The word &#x201C;ashes&#x201D; renders two Hebrew words. One (<em>&#x2BC;e&#x2B9;pher; </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 19:9</a>) is also translated &#x201C;powder.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mal 4:3</a>) <em>De&#x2B9;shen, </em>besides denoting &#x201C;fatty ashes,&#x201D; may also refer to &#x201C;fatness.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Le 1:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 55:2</a>) The Greek noun <em>spo&#xB7;dos&#x2B9; </em>means &#x201C;ashes&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 11:21</a>), while the verb <em>te&#xB7;phro&#x2B9;o </em>means &#x201C;reduce to ashes.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 2:6</a>) The residue from burning could also be referred to as dust (<em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;phar&#x2B9;</em>).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 19:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 23:4</a>.Each day a Levitical priest removed the fatty ashes (<em>de&#x2B9;shen</em>) resulting from the burning of animal sacrifices upon the altar and took them &#x201C;out to a clean place outside the camp.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Le 6:9-11</a>) According to <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Numbers chapter&#xA0;19</a>, a sound red cow without defect and upon which no yoke had come was also slaughtered and burned outside the camp. The ashes of this &#x201C;sin offering&#x201D; were deposited in a clean place outside the camp (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 19:9</a>) and thus a portion was available for mixing with water to be sprinkled on unclean persons or things to purify them. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 19:17</a>) The apostle Paul referred to the figurative cleansing of the flesh by &#x201C;the ashes [Gr., <em>spo&#xB7;dos&#x2B9;</em>] of a heifer&#x201D; to highlight the far greater cleansing of &#x201C;consciences from dead works&#x201D; possible through &#x201C;the blood of the Christ.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 9:13,&#xA0;14</a>.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 31:40</a> refers to &#x201C;the low plain of the carcasses and of the fatty ashes [<em>wehad&#xB7;de&#x2B9;shen</em>],&#x201D; apparently a part of the valley of the son of Hinnom. Until relatively recent times a mound of ashes near the Kidron Valley was a familiar landmark. It is said to have been about 150&#xA0;m long, 60&#xA0;m wide, and 18&#xA0;m deep (490 &#xD7; 200 &#xD7; 60&#xA0;ft) and is considered by some to relate to the place mentioned by Jeremiah. A part of the valley of the son of Hinnom could have been set aside for the disposal of ashes left after burning sacrifices (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Le 4:12</a>), before Josiah made Topheth in the valley unfit for worship.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Jon 3:5,&#xA0;6</a>) Repenting in sackcloth and ashes was a circumstance referred to by Jesus Christ (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 11:21</a>), and in answering Jehovah, Job contritely declared: &#x201C;I do repent in dust and ashes.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Job 42:6</a>.During the 70-year desolation of Judah, the Jews in Babylon mourned over the desolation of Zion or Jerusalem and its temple. But through Isaiah assurance had been given that under the power of Jehovah&#x2019;s spirit there would be action &#x201C;to assign to those mourning over Zion, to give them a headdress instead of ashes.&#x201D; Jesus Christ applied the passage of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000417/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 61:1-3</a> to himself as the Messianic Liberator who would be instrumental in relieving greater spiritual desolation and mourning.
