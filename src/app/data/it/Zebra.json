The stripes distort the shape and unity of the zebra&#x2019;s outline to such an extent that even sharp-eyed natives are often unaware of its presence just 40 or 50&#xA0;m (130 or 160&#xA0;ft) away. The zebra&#x2019;s keen senses of sight and smell, as well as its ability to run swiftly, serve as a protection from carnivores. The animal has been reported to travel at 64&#xA0;km/<wbr>hr (40&#xA0;mph) after its initial burst of speed. Also, its hooves and teeth are effective weapons of defense.The zebra is a wild animal that is hard to tame.
