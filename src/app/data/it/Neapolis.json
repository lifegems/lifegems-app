It is generally <span id=\"page479\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"479\" data-before-text=\"479\"></span>linked with modern Kavalla. This city occupies a rocky promontory at the head of the Gulf of Kavalla. Its harbor is situated on the western side, and Kavalla itself lies about 15&#xA0;km (9.5&#xA0;mi) SE of the ruins of Philippi. Latin inscriptions indicate the city&#x2019;s dependence on Philippi in Roman times, and portions of an aqueduct there appear to be of Roman construction. The Roman-built Egnatian Way connected Neapolis and Philippi and ran westward all the way to Durazzo (Durr&#xEB;s) on the Adriatic Sea.It was at Neapolis that the apostle Paul first entered Europe in response to the call to &#x201C;step over into Macedonia.&#x201D; From there he went to Philippi, this possibly taking him three or four hours as he crossed the mountain range between the two cities.
