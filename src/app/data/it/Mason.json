(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002922/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 6:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002922/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 7:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002922/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 28:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002922/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> Zec 4:10</a>) As shown on monuments, implements used by Egyptian masons included the mallet and chisel, doubtless also employed by Israelite stonemasons. During construction in Egypt, stones were measured and marked with dark lines, which served as guides for the stonecutters, and each stone&#x2019;s position in the building was designated by a mark or number placed on it.Ancient masons were able to dress stones so well that it was not necessary to use mortar. To this day it is impossible to insert a knife blade between the massive stones of certain structural remains in Palestine dating from the Herodian period.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002922/0\">ARCHITECTURE</a>."}
