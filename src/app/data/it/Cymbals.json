(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001098/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 6:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001098/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 15:28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001098/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 5:12,&#xA0;13</a>) The two Hebrew words for cymbals (<em>tsel&#xB7;tselim&#x2B9; </em>and <em>metsil&#xB7;ta&#x2B9;yim</em>) come from the root <em>tsa&#xB7;lal&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;tingle; quiver.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001098/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 3:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001098/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Hab 3:16</a>) According to <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001098/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 15:19</a>, the cymbals for Jehovah&#x2019;s temple were made of copper, but beyond this there is no further Scriptural description. A pair of cymbals have been found in an ancient Egyptian tomb that may be somewhat representative of Biblical cymbals. They are about 14&#xA0;cm (5.5&#xA0;in.) in diameter with handles in the center, and they were made of copper alloyed with a slight amount of silver.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001098/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 150:5</a> indicates that more than one type of cymbal may have been known in Israel. The first occurrence of the term in this text describes &#x201C;cymbals of melodious sound,&#x201D; while the second reference is to &#x201C;clashing cymbals.&#x201D; Because each stanza of verses&#xA0;3 and 4 of this song refers to one or more different musical instruments, the two stanzas of verse&#xA0;5 could quite consistently be referring first to smaller, tinkling cymbals and, second, to cymbals of a larger diameter producing louder, deeper-toned sounds, when clashed together in heavy strokes.The figure of &#x201C;a clashing cymbal&#x201D; is used by the apostle Paul to illustrate the shallowness of one&#x2019;s speaking in tongues, if the motive of love is lacking. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001098/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 13:1</a>) However, other references to cymbals, in addition to those already mentioned, are in connection with the worship of Jehovah.

Praise him with the cymbals.&#x201D;"}
