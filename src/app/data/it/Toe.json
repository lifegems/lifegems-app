The Hebrew and Aramaic words used in the Bible for finger refer also, at times, to the toe.

A custom occasionally practiced to incapacitate a captured enemy for battle was to cut off his thumbs and big toes.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004440/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:6,&#xA0;7</a>.At the installation of the priesthood in Israel, Moses took some blood of the ram of the installation and put it on the right ear, the right thumb, and the right big toe of Aaron and each of his sons. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004440/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Le 8:23,&#xA0;24</a>) The blood of the sacrifice on the prominent member of the right foot meant that they must point their course and walk unswervingly with the best of their ability in the sacrificial duties of the priesthood.
