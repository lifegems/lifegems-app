The name assigned to the letter means &#x201C;house.&#x201D;It has a labial sound similar to the English &#x201C;b&#x201D; when a dot is placed in the middle of this Hebrew character to harden the letter&#x2019;s pronunciation. Without the dot it has a softer sound close to &#x201C;v,&#x201D; as in the word &#x201C;vine.&#x201D;In the Hebrew text, the opening word in each of the eight verses of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000620/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 119:9-16</a> begins with this letter, in keeping with the acrostic style of the psalm.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000620/0\">HEBREW, II</a>."}
