The cave served as a burial place for Abraham&#x2019;s wife Sarah and for at least five others: Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002822/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 23:14-19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002822/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 25:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002822/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 49:30, 31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002822/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 50:13</a>.The burial cave is generally identified with Me&#x2BD;arat HaMakhpela, located in modern Hebron beneath a Moslem mosque within an enclosure called Haram el-Khalil.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002822/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 23:17</a> the Hebrew-language term indicating the position of the cave of Machpelah in relation to Mamre has been variously rendered &#x201C;east of&#x201D; (<em>RS</em>), &#x201C;before&#x201D; (<em>AS</em>), &#x201C;near&#x201D; (<em>BE</em>), &#x201C;opposite&#x201D; (<em>JB</em>), and &#x201C;in front of Mamre&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>). If the traditional location of Mamre (er-Ramat el-Khalil) is correct, the rendering &#x201C;east of Mamre&#x201D; would not be appropriate, since this site lies about 3&#xA0;km (2&#xA0;mi) N of modern Hebron. The phrase &#x201C;Mamre, that is to say, Hebron&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002822/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 23:19</a>), may mean that Mamre was in the district of Hebron."}
