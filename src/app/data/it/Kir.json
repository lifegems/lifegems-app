(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002619/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Am 9:7</a>) Through his prophet <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002619/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Amos (1:5</a>), Jehovah indicated that the Aramaeans would return to Kir, but as exiles. This prophecy was fulfilled when Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III, after being bribed by Judean King Ahaz to do so, captured Damascus, the Aramaean capital, and led its inhabitants into exile at Kir.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002619/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 16:7-9</a>.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002619/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 22:5, 6</a> depicts Kir as readying itself against &#x201C;the valley of the vision&#x201D; (thought to represent Jerusalem). This prophecy is generally understood to have been fulfilled at the time of Assyrian King Sennacherib&#x2019;s campaign against Judah. Because Kir is associated with Elam in this text, some have suggested that it must have been located in the same general area as Elam, E of the Tigris River. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002619/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 21:2</a>, where Elam&#x2019;s known geographic neighbor Media is similarly coupled with Elam.) The Greek <em>Septuagint </em>does not use &#x201C;Kir&#x201D; in any of the previously cited texts but employs several different words for the Hebrew <em>qir. </em>The actual location thus remains uncertain."}
