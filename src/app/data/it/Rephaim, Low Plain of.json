Presumably it got its name from the tall people named the Rephaim who must have lived there at one time. It is listed as a boundary between the territories of Judah and Benjamin.

The traditional identification for the Low Plain of Rephaim is the plain of the Baqa&#x2BD; to the SW of the Temple Mount. It descends for about 1.5&#xA0;km (1&#xA0;mi) and then narrows into the Wadi el Werd (Nahal Refa&#x2BC;im).The plain&#x2019;s fertility (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003696/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 17:5</a>) as well as its proximity to Jerusalem and Bethlehem would have made it desirable to the Philistines.
