They were also more distantly related to the Israelites, and this Biblical relationship is supported by the fact that the Ammonite language was a dialect or variant of Hebrew. With rare exceptions, however, the <span id=\"page93\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"93\" data-before-text=\"93\"></span>Ammonites displayed violent enmity toward the nation of Israel.<strong>Territory Occupied. </strong>Evidently out of consideration for their faithful forefather Lot, Jehovah God enabled the Ammonites to take possession of the territory previously held by the Rephaim, a towering people called the Zamzummim by the Ammonites.

Sometime prior to Israel&#x2019;s entry into Canaan, however, the Amorites had dispossessed the Ammonites of some of their land and pushed them to the N and E, thereby driving a wedge between them and the Moabites (who also suffered the loss of considerable territory).

(See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/1\">NAHASH</a> No.&#xA0;1.) Learning of the siege, Saul proved his merit as king, marshaling the Israelite forces and routing the Ammonites.

Hanun, Nahash&#x2019;s son and successor, greatly angered David, however, by humiliating the messengers David sent to him as bearers of consolation. Becoming aware of the seriousness of the affront committed, the Ammonites sought out mercenary troops from the Syrians and prepared for an offensive against Israel, but they were outmaneuvered and defeated by the Israelite general Joab and his brother Abishai.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 10:1-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 19:6-15</a>.The following spring Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon, came under siege by David&#x2019;s forces. During one desperate sally by the besieged Ammonites, Uriah the Hittite died.

The length of the siege is <span id=\"page94\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"94\" data-before-text=\"94\"></span>difficult to determine. The record of the birth of the adulterine child to Bath-sheba and the later birth of Solomon may fit chronologically within the period of the siege or may simply be given in complete form in order to terminate the account involving Bath-sheba, even though one or both of the births could have taken place after the siege. While the account at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 20:1, 2</a> does not seem to indicate a protracted period, it would not be unusual if the siege had lasted into the following year. The full conquest of the Ammonite capital was finally effected by David.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 12:26-29</a>.&#x201C;The crown of Malcam,&#x201D; referred to in the capture of Rabbah, was evidently a crown placed on the head of the Ammonite idol god, elsewhere called Molech or Milcom. While the <em>Revised Standard Version </em>translates the Hebrew term <em>Mal&#xB7;kam&#x2B9; </em>here as &#x201C;their king,&#x201D; it does not seem logical that a human king is referred to, inasmuch as the crown weighed &#x201C;a talent of gold&#x201D; (c.&#xA0;34&#xA0;kg; 92&#xA0;lb t). It also seems likely that the crown&#x2019;s being placed on David&#x2019;s head was only a momentary act, perhaps to demonstrate the victory over this false god.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 12:30</a>.Because of some renderings of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Samuel 12:31</a> (<em>KJ, AS, Dy</em>), many have understood that the defeated Ammonites were cruelly sawed, axed, and burned to death by David. Later translations (<em>RS, AT, NW, JB</em>), however, evidently give the correct sense, showing that the Ammonites were put to forced labor working with saws and axes and in making bricks. This is substantiated by the fact that the Hebrew term rendered &#x201C;brickkiln&#x201D; in some translations is now known to refer instead to a wooden mold in which the clay was formed into a brick shape.That not all Ammonites were bitter enemies of Israel is evident from the presence of Zelek the Ammonite among David&#x2019;s mighty men. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 23:37</a>) King Solomon had Ammonite women, including the mother of Rehoboam, among his foreign wives.

(<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;B.&#xA0;Pritchard, 1974, p.&#xA0;279) One of the conspirators in the death of King Jehoash of Judah (c.&#xA0;859&#xA0;B.C.E.) was Zabad, the son of the Ammonitess Shimeath.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 27:5</a>) The ability of the Ammonites to pay this large sum during three successive years may have been due to their favorable position along one of the major trade routes from Arabia to Damascus and to the relative fertility of the Jabbok Valley region, wheat and barley still being principal products in this area.Evidently the increasing intervention of Assyrian power in Palestine during the reign of Jotham&#x2019;s successor Ahaz (761-746&#xA0;B.C.E.) allowed the Ammonites to break free of Judean domination but only to exchange it for Assyrian oppression, for the records of Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III list &#x201C;Sanipu of Bit-Ammon [the house of Ammon]&#x201D; as paying tribute to Assyria, along with Ahaz of Judah and Salamanu of Moab. Sennacherib&#x2019;s Prism, recounting his invasion of Judah in Hezekiah&#x2019;s time, likewise shows Ammon bringing gifts to the Assyrian invader, while Sennacherib&#x2019;s son Esar-haddon, a contemporary of Manasseh, includes &#x201C;Puduil, king of Beth-Ammon,&#x201D; among those providing materials for building the city of Nineveh.It appears likely that, following the deporting of the people of the northern kingdom of Israel by Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III and one of his successors (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 15:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/32/1\" data-bid=\"33-2\" class=\"b\"> 17:6</a>), the Ammonites began occupying the territory of the tribe of Gad, for which they had unsuccessfully fought against Jephthah. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 83:4-8</a>.) Thus, in Jehovah&#x2019;s prophetic message through Jeremiah, the Ammonites are rebuked for seizing the Gadites&#x2019; inheritance and are warned of a coming desolation upon Ammon and its god Malcam (Milcom).

Many of the returned Jewish exiles also had taken wives of Ammonite and other foreign extraction and were severely rebuked for this, resulting in a general dismissal of such wives.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 9:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/1\" data-bid=\"48-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:10-19,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/2\" data-bid=\"48-3\" class=\"b\"> 44;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/3\" data-bid=\"48-4\" class=\"b\"> Ne 13:23-27</a>.After Tobiah&#x2019;s ejection from the temple grounds, God&#x2019;s law at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a> prohibiting the entry of Ammonites and Moabites into the congregation of Israel was read and applied.

It does not mean, of necessity, that Ammonite and Moabite individuals could not associate themselves with or reside among the Israelites and thereby benefit from the divine blessings upon God&#x2019;s people, and this is evident from the inclusion of Zelek, mentioned earlier, among David&#x2019;s chief warriors, as well as from the record concerning Ruth the Moabitess.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Ru 1:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/1\" data-bid=\"51-2\" class=\"b\"> 16-18</a>.As to this latter case, Ruth&#x2019;s marriage to Boaz shows that females of these nations, upon turning to the worship of the true God, could be acceptable for marriage by Jewish males. Because the terms &#x201C;Ammonite&#x201D; and &#x201C;Moabite&#x201D; in the Hebrew text of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a> are in the masculine gender, the Jewish Mishnah (<em>Yevamot </em>8:3) argues that only male Ammonites and Moabites were excluded from Israel. Nevertheless, Ezra&#x2019;s insistence that the Jewish men send away their foreign wives and Nehemiah&#x2019;s similar attitude, previously mentioned, indicate that the admission of Ammonite and Moabite females into association with Israel was dependent upon their acceptance of true worship.Though historical evidence, including the Apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees (5:6), shows that Ammon continued to be a distinct territory down till the second century B.C.E., by the first century B.C.E. the region appears to have become part of the Nabataean kingdom, and by the third century C.E. the Ammonites as a people disappear from history, doubtless absorbed by the Arabic tribes.
