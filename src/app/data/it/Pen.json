(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003427/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Zep 2:6</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003427/0\">SHEEPFOLD</a>.) In Micah&#x2019;s prophecy, regathered and united Israel is likened to &#x201C;a flock in the pen.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003427/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 2:12</a>, <em>NW; Le</em>) The Masoretic text here uses the Hebrew word <em>bots&#xB7;rah&#x2B9;, </em>which is elsewhere rendered <span id=\"page597\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"597\" data-before-text=\"597\"></span>&#x201C;Bozrah,&#x201D; the name of a city of Edom and a city of Moab. However, in view of the phraseology of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003427/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Micah 2:12</a>, some scholars feel that <em>bots&#xB7;rah&#x2B9; </em>also means a &#x201C;pen&#x201D; or &#x201C;fold.&#x201D; (<em>JP, Mo</em>) If the word should be vowel pointed slightly differently, it would correspond closely to the Arabic <em>sirat </em>(pen).<strong>PEN, II. </strong>An implement for writing with ink or similar fluid. When ancients wrote on clay, wax, or soft metal they used a stylus (see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003427/1\">STYLUS</a>), but writing was also done on parchment or papyrus with pen and ink. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003427/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">3Jo 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003427/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Jo&#xA0;12</a>) The Greek word translated &#x201C;pen&#x201D; (<em>ka&#x2B9;la&#xB7;mos</em>) refers to a reed or cane and can literally be rendered &#x201C;writing-reed.&#x201D; Among ancient Egyptians the reed pen was made with a flat chisel-shaped head that was cut or sliced so that it would act as a brush. The reeds may have been dried and hardened by leaving them under dung heaps for several months, as has been the practice in recent years. The Greeks and Romans used a reed pen that was pointed and slit, as was later done with quill pens and as has been done even in recent times with pen points."}
