Archaeologists believe that they have found thrones used by rulers or their associates of all these powers, except Moab. An ivory panel, thought to depict a Canaanite throne and footstool, was found at Megiddo. Generally, these non-Israelite thrones have backs and armrests, being richly carved or ornamented. One extant Egyptian throne was made of wood overlaid with gold, while an Assyrian one was of wrought iron with ivory carvings. The throne seems customarily to have been placed on a dais, or raised platform, and in most cases a footstool was present.The only throne of a ruler of Israel described in detail is the one Solomon made. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004391/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 10:18-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004391/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 9:17-19</a>) It appears to have been located in &#x201C;the Porch of the Throne,&#x201D; one of the buildings that stood on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004391/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 7:7</a>) It was &#x2018;a great ivory throne overlaid with refined gold with a round canopy behind it and armrests.&#x2019; Although ivory could have been the basic material in this royal chair, the construction technique generally followed at the temple would seem to indicate that it was made of wood, overlaid with refined gold and richly ornamented with inlaid panels of ivory. To the observer, such a throne would appear to be made entirely of ivory and gold. After mentioning six steps leading to the throne, the record continues: &#x201C;Two lions were standing beside the armrests. And there were twelve lions standing there upon the six steps, on this side and on that side.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004391/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 9:17-19</a>) The symbolism of the lion denoting ruling authority is appropriate.
