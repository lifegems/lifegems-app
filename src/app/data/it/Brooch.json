In ancient times brooches were worn by both men and women, as among the Greeks and Romans. The Roman brooch or fibula sometimes consisted of a curved piece of metal with a hook at one end and a pin extending from the other end, in safety-pin fashion. Being not only ornamental but also useful, the brooch was often used for such purposes as pinning together two parts of a scarf or cloak. Brooches of antiquity were made of bronze, iron, gold, or silver. Their use in early Palestine has been established by archaeological finds, among these being bow-shaped brooches discovered at Tell en-Nasbeh.When the Israelites were granted the privilege of contributing toward the construction of the tabernacle, the men and women brought various ornaments including &#x201C;brooches&#x201D; or &#x201C;buckles.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000828/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 35:21,&#xA0;22</a>) These brooches were evidently hooked ornaments of some type, for the same Hebrew word used for them (<em>chach</em>) is rendered &#x201C;hook&#x201D; elsewhere. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000828/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 19:28</a>) However, the Scriptures do not describe these brooches.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000828/0\">ORNAMENTS</a>."}
