This usage would be consistent with the corresponding Babylonian word that also <span id=\"page429\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"429\" data-before-text=\"429\"></span>describes either a river or a canal. The precise location of the Chebar is unknown.However, most Biblical geographers connect the &#x201C;river Chebar&#x201D; with the Shatt en-Nil, which has been identified with the <em>naru Kabaru </em>(or &#x201C;Grand Canal&#x201D;) mentioned in cuneiform contract tablets found at the city of Nippur, about 85&#xA0;km (50&#xA0;mi) SE of Babylon. The Shatt en-Nil branches off the Euphrates above Babylon and runs in a SE direction, passing near Nippur, to rejoin the Euphrates S of Ur, about 240&#xA0;km (150&#xA0;mi) below Babylon.In 613&#xA0;B.C.E., Tel-abib, near the river Chebar, was the site of the prophet Ezekiel&#x2019;s first recorded vision, the stunning effects of which lasted seven days, and of his being commissioned as &#x201C;a watchman .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. to the house of Israel.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000927/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 1:1&#x2013;3:21</a>) Similar visions on later occasions reminded the prophet of his experience at Chebar.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000927/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 10:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000927/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000927/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000927/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 43:3</a>."}
