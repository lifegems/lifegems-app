Meals also afforded opportunities for showing love and extending hospitality to others. It appears that the Hebrews and early Christians customarily offered prayers in connection with meals.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 9:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 27:35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ti 4:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;3</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/0\">HOSPITALITY</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/1\">LORD&#x2019;S EVENING MEAL</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/2\">LOVE FEASTS</a>.The Israelites appear to have had two main meals each day, one in the morning and the other in the evening at the close of the workday. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ru 3:2, 3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 17:6</a>.) While many ate their breakfasts at home, others, including fishermen who toiled all night, apparently made it a practice to take some food along when going to work. Fishermen could also prepare some of their catch for breakfast.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 8:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 21:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;15</a>.There is evidence, however, that a meal, perhaps usually a lighter one, was served about noon.

King Solomon&#x2019;s table was served by waiters having special attire.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 10:4,&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 9:3,&#xA0;4</a>.Drinks were usually served in individual cups, but food was often placed in a common dish. Those eating might take food with their fingers or use a piece of bread somewhat like a spoon to partake of certain foods.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 14:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 13:25, 26</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 26:15</a>.The postures assumed by persons at meals included reclining and sitting.

Reclining on couches at meals was apparently also a practice among the Persians. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Es 7:8</a>) Tables and couches were used at least by some Israelites in Ezekiel&#x2019;s time.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 23:41</a>.<strong>During the Time of Jesus&#x2019; Earthly Ministry. </strong>The general Hebrew custom in the first century C.E. was for persons to wash their hands before eating a meal. This was a ritualistic practice among the scribes and Pharisees.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 7:1-8</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/3\">WASHING OF HANDS</a>.At banquets or large feasts in the time of Jesus&#x2019; earthly ministry, couches were placed around three sides of a table. This left the fourth side free so that those serving the food could gain access to the table. At times four or five persons occupied one couch, but usually the number was three. Those partaking of the meal usually rested on the left elbow, probably on a cushion, with their heads toward the table. Food was normally taken with the right hand. The place of highest importance on a couch was that occupied by the person having no one behind him. To be in the &#x201C;bosom position&#x201D; in relation to someone else reclining at a meal meant being in front of him and would also signify having his favor. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 13:23</a>) The individual having a person in the bosom position could easily carry on a confidential conversation with him.The customary three positions on each couch indicated that a person had the high, middle, or low position on the couch. When several couches were used, one having the low position on the couch farthest from the host had the lowest position at the meal.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 23:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 14:7-11</a>.At least on certain festive occasions a large meal or banquet might be under the supervision of a director (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 2:9</a>) and could feature such entertainment as &#x201C;a music concert and dancing.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 15:25</a>.<strong>Proper View of Meals. </strong>It is God&#x2019;s will for man to enjoy food and drink.

Since partaking of meals in moderation can be most delightful, the condition of one who is joyful at heart is comparable to a continuous feast. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002945/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 15:15</a>) Also, a loving atmosphere contributes to the enjoyment of a meal.

Therefore one who was privileged to eat regularly at the table of a king was especially favored and enjoyed a very close bond with the monarch.
