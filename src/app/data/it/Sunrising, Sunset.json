These times were pivotal points in the daily life of people in the Biblical period. For most persons, the dawn opened the curtain on the day&#x2019;s activity and the dusk drew it closed again. As the psalmist wrote: &#x201C;The sun .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. sets. You cause darkness, that it may become night; in it all the wild animals of the forest move forth. The maned young lions are roaring for the prey and for seeking their food from God himself. The sun begins to shine<wbr>&#x2014;they withdraw and they lie down in their own hiding places. Man goes forth to his activity and to his service until evening. How many your works are, O&#xA0;Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004261/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 104:19-24</a>.The rising of the sun marked the start of the natural daylight period and, when Jesus Christ was on earth, the start of the counting of the &#x201C;twelve hours of daylight.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004261/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 16:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004261/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 11:9</a>) Many, of course, were up before dawn, like the diligent woman of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004261/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 31:15</a>. Jesus, too, is mentioned as rising before the sun was up, to spend time in prayer. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004261/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 1:35</a>) When sunrise came the large city gates swung open, men went out to their fields or to the vineyards, women lined up at the wells for water, people filled the marketplaces, and fishermen pulled for shore to sell the night&#x2019;s catch, after which they would clean and mend their nets.The day&#x2019;s normal activities and labor went on until sundown. At its approach the men returned from their fields, their masters paid them their wages for the day, women carried their night&#x2019;s supply of water home, the city gates swung shut, and the watchmen began the first of the four night watches, while throughout the city oil lamps began to flicker in the homes.
