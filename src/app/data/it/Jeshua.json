The 9th of the 24 divisions of the Aaronic priesthood as arranged by David was assigned to the house of Jeshua.

Jeshua took the lead, along with Zerubbabel, in setting up the altar, then in rebuilding the temple, encouraged by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah.

Haggai the prophet was sent to speak to Zerubbabel and Joshua (Jeshua), telling them that the glory of the later house would become greater than that of the former one. Jehovah would do this by bringing in &#x201C;the desirable things of all the nations.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002446/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Hag 2:1-4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002446/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002446/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9</a>.The prophet Zechariah was given a vision in which he beheld Joshua (Jeshua) the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan at his right hand to resist him. &#x201C;Joshua&#x201D; was given a change from befouled garments to robes of state and a clean turban. Then &#x201C;Joshua&#x201D; was told of God&#x2019;s servant Sprout.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002446/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 3:1-8</a>.At another time Jehovah told Zechariah to put a <span id=\"page51\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"51\" data-before-text=\"51\"></span>crown on Joshua&#x2019;s (Jeshua&#x2019;s) head and to say to him: &#x201C;Here is the man whose name is Sprout. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. And he himself will build the temple of Jehovah, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. and he must become a priest upon his throne.&#x201D; This prophecy certainly applied to someone future for, under the Law, priesthood and kingship were strictly separate, and High Priest Joshua never ruled as king over Israel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002446/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 6:11-13</a>.<strong>5. </strong>The head of a Levitical house, some of whom returned from Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel in 537&#xA0;B.C.E.
