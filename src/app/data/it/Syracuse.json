According to Thucydides, a Greek colony was established at Syracuse in the eighth century B.C.E.The apostle Paul stayed at Syracuse for three days toward the close of his trip to Rome, in about 59&#xA0;C.E. The layover there may have been necessary because the ship had to wait for suitable sailing wind. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004284/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 28:12</a>) From Syracuse, Paul&#x2019;s ship went &#x201C;around&#x201D; and came to Rhegium, on the southern tip of Italy. The exact meaning of this expression is not known. Possibly the vessel took a somewhat curved route, away from the coast, in order to get sufficient wind to fill its sails. Or, maybe it &#x201C;made a circuit<wbr>&#x2014;following the coast&#x2014;&#x201D; to reach Rhegium.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004284/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 28:13</a>, <em>AB.</em>"}
