(1)&#xA0;In general, it could be applied to the camp of Israel, to Jerusalem and the holy places within it; also, it was specifically used in reference to (2)&#xA0;the entire tent of meeting and, later, the temple; (3)&#xA0;the Most Holy, the innermost compartment of the tabernacle and, later, the temple; and (4)&#xA0;the first interior room of the tabernacle, as distinguished from the Most Holy compartment. In each appearance of the expression &#x201C;holy place,&#x201D; the application intended can be determined from the context.<strong>1. </strong>The <em>camp of Israel </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 23:14</a>); later, the land of Israel and the city of Jerusalem in particular.

God&#x2019;s sanctuary was located there, his name was placed there, and his people were counted holy. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 21:2</a>) The entire camp, and later the entire land that God gave to his people, was to be kept holy. Hence, anyone offering up a sacrifice to a false god or carrying on any unclean practices defiled God&#x2019;s sanctuary, which was located in their midst.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Le 20:3</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Le 18:21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 19:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/6/3\" data-bid=\"7-4\" class=\"b\"> Nu 5:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/6/4\" data-bid=\"7-5\" class=\"b\"> Jer 32:34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/6/5\" data-bid=\"7-6\" class=\"b\"> Eze 5:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002060/6/6\" data-bid=\"7-7\" class=\"b\"> 23:38</a>.<strong>2. </strong>The <em>tent of meeting </em>and, later, the <em>temple. </em>The entire arrangement, including the courtyard of the tabernacle and the temple courts, was a holy place.
