Goodness is solid through and through, with no badness or rottenness. It is a positive quality and expresses itself in the performance of good and beneficial acts toward others. The most common words for &#x201C;good&#x201D; in the Bible are the Hebrew <em>tohv </em>and the Greek <em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;thos&#x2B9;; a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;thos&#x2B9; </em>is usually used in a moral or religious sense.<strong>Jehovah&#x2019;s Goodness. </strong>Jehovah God is good in the absolute and consummate sense. The Scriptures say: &#x201C;Good and upright is Jehovah&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 25:8</a>), and they exclaim: &#x201C;O&#xA0;how great his goodness is!&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 9:17</a>) Jesus Christ, though he had this quality of moral excellence, would not accept &#x201C;Good&#x201D; as a title, saying to one who addressed him as &#x201C;Good Teacher&#x201D;: &#x201C;Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 10:17,&#xA0;18</a>) He thus recognized Jehovah as the ultimate standard of what is good.When Moses asked to see His glory, Jehovah replied: &#x201C;I myself shall cause all my goodness to pass before your face, and I will declare the name of Jehovah before you.&#x201D; Jehovah screened Moses from looking upon his face, but as he passed by (evidently by means of his angelic representative [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 7:53</a>]) he declared to Moses: &#x201C;Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth, preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but by no means will he give exemption from punishment.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 33:18, 19,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 34:6,&#xA0;7</a>.Here goodness is seen to be a quality that involves mercy, loving-kindness, and truth but does not condone or cooperate in any way with badness. On this basis David could pray to Jehovah to forgive his sins &#x2018;for the sake of Jehovah&#x2019;s goodness.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 25:7</a>) Jehovah&#x2019;s goodness, as well as his love, was involved in the giving of his Son as a sacrifice for sins. By this he provided a means for helping those who would want that which is truly good, and at the same time he condemned badness and laid the basis for fully satisfying justice and righteousness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 3:23-26</a>.<strong>A Fruit of the Spirit. </strong>Goodness is a fruit of God&#x2019;s spirit and of the light from his Word of truth. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 5:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Eph 5:9</a>) It is to be cultivated by the Christian. Obedience to Jehovah&#x2019;s commands develops goodness; no man has goodness on his own merit. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 7:18</a>) The psalmist appeals to God as the Source of goodness: &#x201C;Teach me goodness, sensibleness and knowledge themselves, for in your commandments I have exercised faith,&#x201D; and, &#x201C;You are good and are doing good. Teach me your regulations.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 119:66,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;68</a>.<strong>Goodness Bestows Benefits. </strong>Goodness can also mean beneficence, the bestowing of beneficial things upon others. Jehovah desires to express goodness toward his people, as the apostle Paul prayed for the Christians in Thessalonica: &#x201C;We always pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of his calling and perform completely all he pleases of goodness and the work of faith with power.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">2Th 1:11</a>) Many are the examples of God&#x2019;s abundant goodness to those who look to him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 8:66;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 31:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/11/2\" data-bid=\"12-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 63:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/11/3\" data-bid=\"12-4\" class=\"b\"> Jer 31:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/11/4\" data-bid=\"12-5\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;14</a>) Moreover, &#x201C;Jehovah is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 145:9</a>) With a purpose he extends good to all, that his goodness may bring many to serve him and that they may thereby gain life. Likewise, any individual exercising goodness is a blessing to his associates.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 11:10</a>.As servants of God and imitators of him, Christians are commanded to prove what is God&#x2019;s good and perfect will for them (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 12:2</a>); they are to cling to what is good (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 12:9</a>), to do it (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 13:3</a>), to work what is good (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 2:10</a>), to follow after it (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 5:15</a>), to be zealous for it (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:13</a>), to imitate what is good (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">3Jo&#xA0;11</a>), and to conquer evil with it (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 12:21</a>). Their doing of good is to be especially extended to those related to them in the Christian faith; additionally, it is to be practiced toward all others.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 6:10</a>.<strong>A Related Term. </strong>Similar to the Greek word for good (<em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;thos&#x2B9;</em>) is another word, <em>ka&#xB7;los&#x2B9;. </em>The latter denotes that which is intrinsically good, beautiful, well adapted to its circumstances or ends (as fine ground, or soil; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 13:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>), and that which is of fine quality, including that which is ethically good, right, or honorable (as God&#x2019;s name; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 2:7</a>). It is closely related in meaning to good, but may be distinguished by being translated &#x201C;fine,&#x201D; &#x201C;right,&#x201D; &#x201C;honest,&#x201D; or &#x201C;well.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 3:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> Jas 4:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/25/2\" data-bid=\"26-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 13:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/25/3\" data-bid=\"26-4\" class=\"b\"> Ro 14:21</a>."}
