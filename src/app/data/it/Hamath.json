The rich agricultural region surrounding it also took the same name. During Greek and Roman times the classical name of the city was Epiphania, so named by Antiochus&#xA0;IV (Epiphanes). Today it is called Hama, a shortened form of its original name.The city of Hamath was located on the Orontes River, along important trade routes, 81&#xA0;km (50&#xA0;mi) inland from the Mediterranean, about 190&#xA0;km (118&#xA0;mi) N of Damascus and about 120&#xA0;km (75&#xA0;mi) S of Aleppo.Though sometimes said to be of Hittite origin, Hamath was more likely founded by the <em>Hamathites, </em><span id=\"page1025\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1025\" data-before-text=\"1025\"></span>relatives of the Hittites and one of the 70 post-Flood families.
