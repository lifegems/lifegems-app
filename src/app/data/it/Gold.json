(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:11</a>) From the beginning it has been a noble metal highly valued for its weight, rarity, durable nontarnishing luster, shimmering beauty, ductility, and malleability. A number of Hebrew terms refer to gold; included are <em>za&#xB7;hav&#x2B9; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 25:11</a>), <em>cha&#xB7;ruts&#x2B9; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 9:3</a>), <em>ke&#x2B9;them </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 45:9</a>), <em>paz </em>(&#x201C;refined gold&#x201D;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 19:10</a>), <em>seghohr&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;pure gold&#x201D;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Job 28:15</a>), and <em>&#x2BC;oh&#xB7;phir&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;gold of Ophir&#x201D;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 22:24</a>). The Greek terms <em>khry&#xB7;sos&#x2B9; </em>and <em>khry&#xB7;si&#x2B9;on </em>of the Christian Greek Scriptures are used with reference to coins, ornaments, and the metal in general; they are also used in a metaphoric sense.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 3:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> Mt 2:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 3:12</a>.Gold&#x2019;s rarity gave it a monetary value that made it useful as a commercial medium of exchange and as a measure of wealth and prominence. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 13:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 21:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> Es 8:15</a>) Gold coinage was a late invention, however. The color and luster of gold and its resistance to oxidation, or tarnishing, make it especially valuable for jewelry and ornamentation of all kinds.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 24:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 41:42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> Jg 8:24-26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/9/3\" data-bid=\"10-4\" class=\"b\"> Ps 45:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/9/4\" data-bid=\"10-5\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>.When found in its native purity in gravel deposits and riverbeds, gold can easily be separated and recovered, because of its great weight. The book of Job mentions mining and refining operations.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Job 28:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;6</a>.<strong>Used in Tabernacle and Temple. </strong>Gold&#x2019;s malleability permits it to be hammered into countless shapes. In the construction of the tabernacle, gold was beaten into plates for overlay work and into thin sheets cut into thread that was woven into certain garments of the high priest. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 25:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> 30:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/11/2\" data-bid=\"12-3\" class=\"b\"> 37:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/11/3\" data-bid=\"12-4\" class=\"b\"> 39:2,&#xA0;3</a>) It was similarly used in the temple built by Solomon.

This process was also employed in ancient Israel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 10:16</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/0\">ELECTRUM</a>.A great quantity of gold was used in the tabernacle, the current value of this gold being estimated at about $11,269,000. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 25:10-40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> 38:24</a>) However, in comparison with the amount of gold used, the wilderness tabernacle was only a miniature of Solomon&#x2019;s glorious temple. David had set aside no less than 100,000 talents of gold for that temple, valued today in excess of $38,535,000,000.

The account says: &#x201C;The weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year amounted up to six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold [c. $256,643,000].&#x201D; That was apart from revenues from traders, governors, and so forth.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 9:14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> 27, 28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/17/2\" data-bid=\"18-3\" class=\"b\"> 10:10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001737/17/3\" data-bid=\"18-4\" class=\"b\"> 14,&#xA0;15</a>.Ophir was one place from which Solomon acquired fine gold.

Nonetheless, the apostle Peter points to faith&#x2019;s unexcelled durability and permanent value. He states that the tested quality of one&#x2019;s faith is of much greater value than gold, which can withstand fire yet can wear away and be destroyed by other means. Christians have to endure various trials that are sometimes grievous, but this serves to bring out the quality of their faith.

Daniel interpreted the parts of the image as representing world powers, the head of gold being Nebuchadnezzar, that is, the imperial dynasty of Babylon&#x2019;s kings headed by Nebuchadnezzar.

Since the Most Holy with its golden ark of the covenant represented heaven, God&#x2019;s dwelling place, and since priests, but not ordinary Israelites, could enter the Holy Place, these things would logically represent things having to do with the heavens of God and with his &#x201C;royal priesthood,&#x201D; that is, those with the heavenly calling, and their activity and duties toward God.
