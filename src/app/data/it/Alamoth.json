It probably refers to the soprano voices of young women or the falsetto of boys. In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 15:20</a>, stringed instruments are described as being &#x201C;tuned to Alamoth,&#x201D; the term being transliterated. However, in the superscription to <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 46</a> <em>&#x2BD;ala&#xB7;mohth&#x2B9; </em>is translated &#x201C;Maidens.&#x201D;At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 15:21</a>, the verse following the above citation, another musical expression is transliterated, namely, <em>shemi&#xB7;nith&#x2B9;, </em>referring to &#x201C;harps tuned to Sheminith.&#x201D; In the superscriptions of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Psalms 6</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">12</a> this word is translated &#x201C;lower octave.&#x201D; While the two terms Alamoth and Sheminith are not necessarily opposites in meaning, some scholars believe they do stand in contrast to each other. The contents of the respective psalms seem to indicate this also: Both psalms (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">6</a> and&#xA0;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">12</a>) containing <em>shemi&#xB7;nith&#x2B9; </em>in their superscriptions are somewhat plaintive and would accordingly be accompanied in a more somber, lower range; whereas <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 46</a>, containing <em>&#x2BD;ala&#xB7;mohth&#x2B9; </em>in its superscription, is joyous and reasonably would have accompaniment or be sung in a higher register.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/0\">HARP</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000189/1\">MUSIC</a>."}
