(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002094/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 29:38-42</a>) So it came about that expressions such as &#x201C;the going up of the grain offering,&#x201D; where the context indicates whether morning or evening (as at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002094/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 18:29,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002094/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;36</a>), and &#x201C;the time of the evening gift offering&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002094/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Da 9:21</a>) referred to a fairly well-defined time.The night was divided into three periods called watches.

These hours would not always be of the same length from day to day, because of the change of seasons, making the daylight hours longer and the night hours shorter in summertime (except at the equator). Our modern-day division of the day into 24 hours of 60 minutes each results from a combination of Egyptian reckoning and Babylonian mathematics, a sexagesimal system (founded on the number&#xA0;60). The practice of counting the day from midnight to midnight, thereby eliminating the seasonal variation in the length of the hours, was a later development, perhaps Roman.<span id=\"page1153\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1153\" data-before-text=\"1153\"></span><strong>In the First Century. </strong>In the first century C.E., the Jews used the count of 12 hours to the day, starting with sunrise. &#x201C;There are twelve hours of daylight, are there not?&#x201D; said Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002094/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 11:9</a>) Of course, this made the hours vary in length from one day to the next, according to the seasons; the only times that they were of the same length as our hours was at the time of the equinoxes. Evidently this slight variation, which would not be so great in Palestine, did not create any major inconvenience. The start of the day would correspond to about 6:00&#xA0;a.m., our time. In the illustration of the workers in the vineyard, Jesus made mention of the 3rd hour, the 6th, 9th, 11th, and, one hour later, &#x201C;evening&#x201D; (which would be the 12th). These times would correspond to our 8:00 to 9:00&#xA0;a.m., 11:00&#xA0;a.m. to noon, 2:00 to 3:00&#xA0;p.m., 4:00 to 5:00&#xA0;p.m., and 5:00 to 6:00&#xA0;p.m., respectively.

John had access to Mark&#x2019;s account, and he certainly could have repeated the time stated by Mark. Therefore John must have had a reason for stating the hour differently from Mark.Why the seeming discrepancy? A variety of suggestions have been offered. None of these satisfy all objections. We simply do not have enough information to explain with any certainty the reason for this difference between the accounts. Perhaps Mark&#x2019;s or John&#x2019;s reference to the hour was parenthetical, not in chronological order. Whatever the case, one thing is certain: Both writers were inspired by holy spirit.The synoptic Gospels clearly indicate that by the sixth hour, or 12&#xA0;noon, Jesus had already been hanging on the stake long enough for the soldiers to cast lots over his garments and for the chief priests, the scribes, the soldiers, and other passersby to speak abusively of him. They also indicate that about 3:00&#xA0;p.m. Jesus expired.
