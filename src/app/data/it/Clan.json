(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000985/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 25:16</a>) The same is true of the descendants of Midian. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000985/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 25:15</a>) The term is also found in Hebrew poetry at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000985/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 117:1</a>, where it appears in a parallelism with &#x201C;nations.&#x201D;The Hebrew word <em>she&#x2B9;vet, </em>which is usually rendered &#x201C;tribe,&#x201D; is translated &#x201C;clan&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000985/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Numbers 18:2</a>. This is an exceptional instance to show the distinction the Hebrew text makes, for in this verse the two words <em>mat&#xB7;teh&#x2B9; </em>and <em>she&#x2B9;vet </em>appear, both of which are normally rendered &#x201C;tribe.&#x201D;"}
