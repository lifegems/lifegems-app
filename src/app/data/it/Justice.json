The Hebrew word <em>mish&#xB7;pat&#x2B9;, </em>often translated &#x201C;justice&#x201D; or &#x201C;judgment&#x201D; (<em>NW, RS</em>), may also convey the idea of a particular plan (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002558/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 26:30</a>), custom (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002558/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 40:13</a>), rule (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002558/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 4:20</a>), or regular procedure (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002558/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Le 5:10</a>) for doing things.The two Hebrew words most frequently translated &#x201C;justice&#x201D; in the <em>King James Version </em>(<em>tse&#x2B9;dheq </em>and <em>tsedha&#xB7;qah&#x2B9;</em>) are usually rendered &#x201C;righteousness&#x201D; in the <em>New World Translation. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002558/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 18:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002558/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Job 8:3</a>) Whereas justice has legal associations, basically there is no distinction between justice and righteousness.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002558/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Am 5:24</a>.One Greek word translated &#x201C;in harmony with justice&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>) designates something that is &#x201C;just&#x201D; (<em>KJ, RS</em>) or deserved.

Said God to the Israelites: &#x201C;As for my ways, are they not adjusted right, O&#xA0;house of Israel?

This truth was acknowledged by the famous English jurist Blackstone: &#x201C;[God] has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Chadman&#x2019;s Cyclopedia of Law, </em>1912, Vol.&#xA0;I, p.&#xA0;88.The proper exercise of justice by governmental authority likewise contributes to the happiness and well-being of its subjects.
