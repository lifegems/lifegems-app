In humans, for example, when the heart stops beating, the blood ceases to circulate nourishment and oxygen (obtained by breathing) to the billions of body cells. However, <em>The World Book Encyclopedia </em>(1987, Vol.&#xA0;5, p.&#xA0;52b) pointed out: &#x201C;A person whose heart and lungs stop working may be considered <em>clinically dead, </em>but somatic death may not yet have occurred. The individual cells of the body continue to live for several minutes. The person may be revived if the heart and lungs start working again and give the cells the oxygen they need. After about three minutes, the brain cells<wbr>&#x2014;which are most sensitive to a lack of oxygen&#x2014;<wbr>begin to die. The person is soon dead beyond any possibility of revival. Gradually, other cells of the body also die. The last ones to perish are the bone, hair, and skin cells, which may continue to grow for several hours.&#x201D; Thus while the vital importance of breathing and of the blood in maintaining the active life-force (<em>ru&#x2B9;ach chai&#xB7;yim&#x2B9;</em>) in the body cells is evident, at the same time it is also clear that it is not the cessation of breathing or of heartbeat alone but the disappearance of the life-force or spirit from the body cells that brings death as referred to in the Scriptures.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 104:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 146:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> Ec 8:8</a>.<strong>Cause of Death in Humans. </strong>The first reference to death in the Scriptures occurs at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 2:16, 17</a> in God&#x2019;s command to the first man concerning the eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, violation of which command would result in death. (See <em>NW </em>ftn.) However, death among animals as a natural process was evidently already in effect, since they are passed over completely in the Biblical presentation of the introduction of death into the human family. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 2:12</a>.) The gravity of God&#x2019;s warning about the death penalty for disobedience would therefore be understandable to his human son, Adam. Adam&#x2019;s disobedience to his Creator brought death to him.
