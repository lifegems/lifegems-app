The roebuck (<em>Capreolus capreolus</em>) stands over 0.6&#xA0;m (2&#xA0;ft) high at the shoulder and measures about 1.2&#xA0;m (4&#xA0;ft) in length. Only the males have antlers, and these are shed each year. The roebuck&#x2019;s summer coat is reddish brown, and this may have been the basis for its Hebrew name <em>yach&#xB7;mur&#x2B9;, </em>considered to be derived from a root meaning &#x201C;be red.&#x201D; This animal is not generally gregarious. Small groups of three or four, the buck, the doe, and a fawn or two, may be seen feeding together. The roebuck has one mate for life.Being a chewer of the cud and a splitter of the hoof, the roebuck was acceptable for food according to the terms of the Mosaic Law.
