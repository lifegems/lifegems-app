However, there was no real unanimity of thought among them, some restricting it to the celestial bodies only, others using it for the whole universe. The use of <em>ko&#x2B9;smos </em>to describe the material creation as a whole appears in some Apocryphal writings (compare Wisdom 9:9; 11:17), these being written during the period when Greek philosophy was making inroads in many Jewish areas. But in the inspired writings of the Christian Greek Scriptures this sense is virtually, perhaps entirely, absent. Some texts may appear to use the term in that sense, such as the account of the apostle&#x2019;s address to the Athenians at the Areopagus. Paul there said: &#x201C;The God that made the world [form of <em>ko&#x2B9;smos</em>] and all the things in it, being, as this One is, Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade temples.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 17:22-24</a>) Since the use of <em>ko&#x2B9;smos </em>as meaning the universe was current among the Greeks, Paul might have employed the term in that sense. Even here, however, it is entirely possible that he used it in one of the ways discussed in the rest of this article.<strong>Linked With Mankind. </strong>Richard C.&#xA0;Trench&#x2019;s <em>Synonyms of the New Testament </em>(London, 1961, pp.&#xA0;201, 202), after presenting the philosophic use of <em>ko&#x2B9;smos </em>for the universe, says: &#x201C;From this signification of &#x3BA;&#x3CC;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; [<em>ko&#x2B9;smos</em>] as the material universe, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. followed that of &#x3BA;&#x3CC;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; as that external framework of things in which man lives and moves, which exists for him and of which he constitutes the moral centre (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">John xvi. 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> I Cor. xiv. 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/16/2\" data-bid=\"17-3\" class=\"b\"> I John iii.&#xA0;17</a>); .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. and then the men themselves, the sum total of persons living in the world (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">John i. 29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> iv. 42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/17/2\" data-bid=\"18-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;II Cor. v.&#xA0;19</a>); and then upon this, and ethically, all not of the &#x1F10;&#x3BA;&#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3AF;&#x3B1; [<em>ek&#xB7;kle&#xB7;si&#x2B9;a; </em>the church or congregation], alienated from the life of God and by wicked works enemies to Him (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">I Cor. i. 20, 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;II Cor. vii. 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/18/2\" data-bid=\"19-3\" class=\"b\"> Jam. iv.&#xA0;4</a>).&#x201D;Similarly, the book <em>Studies in the Vocabulary of the Greek New Testament, </em>by K.&#xA0;S.&#xA0;Wuest (1946, p.&#xA0;57), quotes Greek scholar Cremer as saying: &#x201C;As <em>kosmos </em>is regarded as that order of things whose center is man, attention is directed chiefly to him, and <em>kosmos </em>denotes mankind within that order of things, humanity as it manifests itself in and through such an order (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Mt. 18:7</a>).&#x201D;<strong><em>All humankind. </em></strong><em>Ko&#x2B9;smos, </em>or the &#x201C;world,&#x201D; is therefore closely linked and bound up with <em>mankind. </em>This is true in secular Greek literature and is particularly so in Scripture. When Jesus said that the man walking in daylight &#x201C;sees the light of this world [form of <em>ko&#x2B9;smos</em>]&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 11:9</a>), it might appear that by &#x201C;world&#x201D; is meant simply the planet Earth, which has the sun as its source of daylight. However, his next words speak of the man walking at night who bumps into something &#x201C;because the light is not <em>in him.&#x201D; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 11:10</a>) It is primarily for mankind that God gave the sun and other heavenly bodies.

These texts speak of certain things as taking place &#x2018;from the founding of the world.&#x2019; These include the &#x2018;shedding of the blood of the prophets&#x2019; from the time of Abel onward, a &#x2018;kingdom prepared,&#x2019; and &#x2018;names being written on the scroll of life.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 11:50, 51;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/36/1\" data-bid=\"37-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 25:34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/36/2\" data-bid=\"37-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 13:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/36/3\" data-bid=\"37-4\" class=\"b\"> 17:8</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 13:35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 9:26</a>.) Such things relate to human life and activity, and hence &#x201C;the founding of the world&#x201D; must relate to the beginning of mankind, not of the inanimate creation or the animal creation. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 4:3</a> shows that God&#x2019;s creative works were, not <em>started, </em>but <em>&#x201C;finished </em>from the founding of the world.&#x201D; Since Eve was evidently the last of Jehovah&#x2019;s earthly creative works, the world&#x2019;s founding could not precede her.As shown under <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/3\">ABEL</a> (No.&#xA0;1) and <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/4\">FOREKNOWLEDGE, FOREORDINATION</a> (Foreordination of the Messiah), the Greek term (<em>ka&#xB7;ta&#xB7;bo&#xB7;le&#x2B9;</em>) for &#x201C;founding&#x201D; can refer to the conceiving of seed in human conception. <em>Ka&#xB7;ta&#xB7;bo&#xB7;le&#x2B9; </em>literally means &#x201C;a throwing down [of seed]&#x201D; and at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 11:11</a> may be rendered &#x201C;conceive&#x201D; (<em>RS, NW</em>).

Peter writes that God brought the Deluge &#x201C;upon a world of ungodly people,&#x201D; while preserving Noah and his family; in this way &#x201C;the world of that time suffered destruction when it was deluged with water.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/85/0\" data-bid=\"86-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 2:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/85/1\" data-bid=\"86-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:6</a>) It may again be noted that the reference here is not to the destruction of the planet or of the celestial bodies of the universe, but it is restricted to the human sphere, in this case the unrighteous human society.

After the Flood the majority of mankind again deviated from righteousness, producing another wicked human society. Still there were those who took a separate course, adhering to righteousness. In course of time God designated Israel as his chosen people, bringing them into covenant relationship with himself. Because the Israelites were thus made distinct from the world in general, Paul could use <em>ko&#x2B9;smos, </em>&#x201C;world,&#x201D; as equivalent to the non-Israelite &#x201C;people of the nations,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Gentiles,&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/87/0\" data-bid=\"88-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 11:12-15</a>. (<em>NW; KJ</em>) He there pointed out that Israel&#x2019;s apostasy led to God&#x2019;s revoking his covenant relationship with them and that it opened up the way for the Gentiles to enter into such relationship and its riches, by being reconciled to God. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004627/88/0\" data-bid=\"89-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 2:11-13</a>.)

This is the world that hated Jesus and his followers because they bore witness concerning its unrighteousness and because they maintained separateness from it; such world thereby showed hatred for Jehovah God himself and did not come to know him.
