It derives its English name from the two numberings of the sons of Israel mentioned therein. It relates events that took place in the region of Mount Sinai, in the wilderness during the course of Israel&#x2019;s wandering, and on the <span id=\"page514\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"514\" data-before-text=\"514\"></span>Plains of Moab.

In commenting about the time Hebron was built, the writer used the Egyptian city of Zoan as a reference point.
