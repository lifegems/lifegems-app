One Hebrew expression rendered &#x2018;forehead&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001547/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 14:1</a>) and the Greek word for &#x201C;forehead&#x201D; (<em>me&#x2B9;to&#xB7;pon</em>) literally mean &#x201C;between the eyes.&#x201D; As a very prominent and readily seen feature of an individual, the forehead was, in ancient times, a place for marking slaves so that all could see to what master they belonged. Also, the devotees of certain pagan gods were thus marked. Even today some follow the practice of putting religious marks on the forehead, so that all others can be aware of their devotion to their religious beliefs.<strong>Mark in the Forehead. </strong>Bearing a mark in the &#x201C;forehead&#x201D; is similarly used in a figurative way in the Bible to signify that one is a slave to the true God or to another. At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001547/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 7:2-4</a>, reference is made to angelic sealing of 144,000 persons in their foreheads. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001547/0\">SEAL</a>.) In another part of the vision of Revelation, the 144,000 are represented as having the name of the Lamb, Jesus Christ, and the name of his Father written on their foreheads. As the bride of the Lamb, they would properly take his name.

It also served as a suitable picture of the great High Priest, Jesus Christ, and his being dedicated by Jehovah to this priestly service that upholds God&#x2019;s holiness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001547/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:26</a>.<strong>Babylon the Great. </strong>Conversely, the symbolic great harlot has the name &#x201C;Babylon the Great&#x201D; on her forehead.
