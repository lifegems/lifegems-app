It is believed that the wild boar (not to be confused with the male of the domesticated hog, to which it is related) is meant. This animal (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) is still to be found in the swamps of Palestine.A large wild boar may weigh some 160&#xA0;kg (350&#xA0;lb), measure nearly 1.5&#xA0;m (5&#xA0;ft) in length, and may stand 1&#xA0;m (3&#xA0;ft) high at the shoulder. The snout of the wild boar is specially suited to rooting for food amid forest undergrowth. The tusks, especially those of the male, constitute a formidable weapon, with which it can easily rip up a horse. This animal is not only dangerous but also destructive, it being said that a group of them can ruin an entire vineyard in one night. Its diet, although basically vegetarian, includes a great variety of foods such as roots, grain, earthworms, snails, small animals, birds&#x2019; eggs, and the like."}
