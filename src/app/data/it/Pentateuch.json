Its first book, Genesis, gives us the inspired account of creation and also traces man&#x2019;s history from Eden down through much of the patriarchal era to the death of Joseph (&#x201C;in the beginning&#x201D; to 1657&#xA0;B.C.E.). The second book, Exodus, begins with the death of Joseph and tells of Moses&#x2019; birth during a time of slavery, of the deliverance of God&#x2019;s people from Egyptian bondage, and of the inauguration of the Law covenant at Sinai; it includes details for the construction of the central structure for worship, namely, the tabernacle in the wilderness (historic events from 1657 to 1512&#xA0;B.C.E.). Leviticus, the third book, covering only about one month&#x2019;s time (1512&#xA0;B.C.E.), gives invaluable information about the Levitical priesthood, its ordination, and its duties, as well as laws and regulations governing the congregation&#x2019;s obligatory support of Jehovah&#x2019;s worship. The fourth book, Numbers, as its name implies, tells of the censuses taken near the beginning and end of the wilderness journey. It also gives us many details on the 40 years of wandering (down to 1473&#xA0;B.C.E.) and includes many laws embraced within the framework of the national covenant. The final book, Deuteronomy, covers about two months&#x2019; time (1473&#xA0;B.C.E.); it explains portions of the Law covenant and provides many ordinances necessary for the new generation of Israelites who were poised on the Plains of Moab, ready to invade and occupy the Promised Land. The closing chapters tell of the appointment of Joshua as leader and the death of Moses.<strong>Writership. </strong>There is no single text saying that Moses wrote the entire Pentateuch, but scattered throughout the material are explicit statements serving the same purpose.

The same is true in more than 50 instances in the book of Numbers. So, with the exception of the closing verses of Deuteronomy, the evidence within the Pentateuch itself shows that its writership properly belongs to Moses.Many other passages in the Bible witness to the fact that the Pentateuch was from the hand of Moses.
