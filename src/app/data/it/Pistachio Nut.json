This deciduous tree thrives in dry areas and seldom reaches a height in excess of 9&#xA0;m (30&#xA0;ft). The nuts measure 1.5 to 2&#xA0;cm (0.6 to 0.8&#xA0;in.) in length and grow in large clusters. The thin, but hard, light-colored shell of ripe pistachio nuts is covered with a somewhat wrinkly husk. Each nut contains one yellow-green kernel surrounded by thin reddish skin. The kernel has a mild, sweet flavor and is commonly eaten raw or fried. Sometimes kernels are pressed for oil, and ground kernels are used for confectionery items.Pistachio nuts were among &#x201C;the finest products of the land&#x201D; of Canaan that were brought as a gift by Jacob&#x2019;s sons to one who was a ruler in Egypt.
