{"title":"Barbarian","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000560","html":"<span id=\"page255\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"255\" data-before-text=\"255\"></span><strong>BARBARIAN</strong>(Bar&#xB7;bar&#x2B9;ian).The repetition of <em>&#x201C;bar bar&#x201D; </em>in the Greek <em>bar&#x2B9;ba&#xB7;ros </em>conveyed the idea of stammering, babble, or unintelligible speech; hence the term &#x201C;barbarian&#x201D; was originally applied by the Greeks to a foreigner, particularly one speaking a different tongue. At that time it did not indicate lack of civilization, refinement, or good manners, nor did it convey any feeling of hostile contempt. &#x201C;Barbarian&#x201D; simply distinguished especially non-Greeks from Greeks, much the same as &#x201C;Gentile&#x201D; divides off non-Jews from Jews. These non-Greeks did not object or feel insulted because they were called barbarians. Some Jewish writers, including Josephus, recognized themselves as being designated by the term (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>XIV, 187 [x,&#xA0;1]; <em>Against Apion, </em>I, 58 [11]); Romans called themselves barbarians until they adopted Greek culture. It is in this not unfavorable light, then, that Paul in writing to the Romans used an all-inclusive expression: &#x201C;Both to Greeks and to Barbarians.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000560/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 1:14</a>.The principal factor separating Greeks from the barbarian world was their language; hence the term had special reference to those who did not speak Greek, as, for example, the inhabitants of Malta who spoke an unrelated tongue. In this instance the <em>New World Translation </em>gives meaning to <em>bar&#x2B9;ba&#xB7;roi </em>by rendering it &#x201C;foreign-speaking people.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000560/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 28:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000560/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;4</a>) Writing on the gift of tongues, Paul twice calls one speaking in an unintelligible tongue <em>bar&#x2B9;ba&#xB7;ros </em>(&#x201C;foreigner&#x201D;). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000560/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 14:11</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000560/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Col 3:11</a>.) Similarly, the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>uses <em>bar&#x2B9;ba&#xB7;ros </em>at Psalm 113:1 (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000560/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">114:1</a> in Hebrew and English versions) and Ezekiel 21:36 (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000560/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">21:31</a> in English).<span id=\"page256\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"256\" data-before-text=\"256\"></span>Because the Greeks felt that their language and culture were superior to all others, and because they suffered indignities at the hand of their enemies, the term &#x201C;barbarian&#x201D; gradually assumed its common disparaging connotation."}
