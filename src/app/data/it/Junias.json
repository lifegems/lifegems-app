Andronicus and Junias were his &#x201C;relatives.&#x201D; While the Greek word used here can mean &#x201C;fellow-countryman,&#x201D; the primary meaning is &#x201C;blood relative of the same generation.&#x201D; The two were Paul&#x2019;s &#x201C;fellow captives,&#x201D; possibly having been in prison with him somewhere. Paul calls them both &#x201C;men of note among the apostles,&#x201D; perhaps recalling their fine reputation with the apostles. They were &#x2018;in union with Christ longer than Paul himself was,&#x2019; indicating early discipleship."}
