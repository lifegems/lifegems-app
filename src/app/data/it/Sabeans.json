These Sabeans took Job&#x2019;s cattle and she-asses and slaughtered his attendants. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:14,&#xA0;15</a>) Job also mentions &#x201C;the traveling company of Sabeans,&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job 6:19</a>.It is difficult to identify with certainty these Sabeans, since they might have been descendants of a number of different men named Sheba. Abraham&#x2019;s son Jokshan had a son named Sheba (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 25:1-3</a>), and the possibility of the Sabean raiders&#x2019; being from this line cannot be ruled out. However, scholars more commonly suggest that the Sabeans came through the Sheba who descended from Ham through Cush (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:6,&#xA0;7</a>) or Sheba the son of Joktan in Shem&#x2019;s line.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:21-29</a>.<strong>2. </strong>A tall people linked in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 45:14</a> with laborers of Egypt and merchants of Ethiopia as ones who would recognize Jehovah and his people. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 43:3</a> also associates Egypt and Ethiopia but, instead of &#x201C;Sabeans,&#x201D; uses &#x201C;Seba,&#x201D; indicating that the men of Seba were called Sabeans.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/0\">SEBA</a> No.&#xA0;2.<strong>3. </strong>The descendants of Sheba (whether of the line of Shem or of Ham is uncertain) who evidently formed a kingdom near the tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Likely the queen of Sheba who visited Solomon was from this land. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 10:1</a>) Secular sources often refer to this kingdom as Sabean, and the Bible may do likewise.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/1\">SHEBA</a> No.&#xA0;6.Certain translations read &#x201C;Sabeans&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003781/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 23:42</a> (<em>KJ, Yg, Da</em>), so interpreting the marginal reading in the Hebrew Bible. However, the main text reads &#x201C;drunkards,&#x201D; and that is how modern translations frequently render the verse.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Ro, NW, AS, RS.</em>"}
