Its being mentioned after Ai (Aiath) and before Michmash appears to locate Migron N, not S, of Michmash. Therefore, a second Migron (Makrun to the NW of Michmash) has been suggested. However, if the Migron of Saul&#x2019;s day was still in existence, it seems unlikely that there would be another town by the same name less than 3&#xA0;km (2&#xA0;mi) away. So the prophecy may simply be listing cities to be affected by the Assyrian invasion and that without regard for the order or geographic position of one city in relation to another.
