Demas was in Rome with the apostle during his first imprisonment there, his greetings being included in letters to the Colossians and to Philemon.

The apostle does not say Demas became an apostate or opposer. Perhaps Demas&#x2019; love for material things and worldly pleasures became stronger than that for spiritual things. Fear of martyrdom with Paul may have caused Demas to seek a safer place and thus preserve his life in the then-existing system of things. In any event, when conditions became unfavorable, Demas failed to use his marvelous opportunity to strengthen his brother Paul."}
