Tobiah was &#x201C;the servant,&#x201D; likely some official under the Persian king. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:19</a>) Both he and his son Jehohanan married Jewish women, and Tobiah was also related to High Priest Eliashib. This put Tobiah in a position of advantage for undermining Nehemiah&#x2019;s authority, in that many Jews looked up to and spoke highly of Tobiah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 6:17-19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 13:4</a>.When Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem, Tobiah and his associates were displeased with Israel&#x2019;s brightening prospect. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:9,&#xA0;10</a>) At first they merely derided and mocked the Jews (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 4:3</a>), but when the wall rebuilding made progress, they became very angry. However, various conspiracies<wbr>&#x2014;to kill off the Jews (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 4:7-9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 14,&#xA0;15</a>), and an attempt to get Nehemiah to violate the sanctity of the temple (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 6:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 10-13</a>)&#x2014;<wbr>all failed. Even after the walls were completed, Tobiah, through correspondence with his sympathizers in Jerusalem, attempted to intimidate Nehemiah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 6:16-19</a>) Properly, therefore, Nehemiah asked Jehovah to remember the many wicked deeds of Tobiah and his confederates. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 6:14</a>) On Nehemiah&#x2019;s second arrival from Babylon, when he found a dining room in the temple court reserved for Tobiah, he promptly threw Tobiah&#x2019;s things out.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004437/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 13:4-9</a>."}
