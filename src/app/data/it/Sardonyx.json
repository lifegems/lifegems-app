It is an onyx composed of two or more layers of milk-white chalcedony and transparent red sard. However, the contrasting layer is sometimes golden or brown. The red layer showing through the white one appeared much like the color of a fingernail to the Greeks, which was probably why they applied to it the Greek word <em>o&#x2B9;nyx </em>(meaning &#x201C;fingernail&#x201D;). Sardonyx is found in various places, including Palestine and Arabia.The stone is mentioned once in the Bible, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003841/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 21:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003841/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 19, 20</a>, where the fifth foundation stone of &#x201C;the holy city, New Jerusalem,&#x201D; is a sardonyx stone."}
