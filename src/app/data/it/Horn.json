(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002080/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:13</a>) It is used once to refer to a wind instrument, namely, in the expression &#x201C;horn [Heb., <em>qe&#x2B9;ren</em>] of the ram&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002080/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 6:5</a>. This expression is put in parallel with the Hebrew word <em>shoh&#xB7;phar&#x2B9; </em>(horn), a term always referring to a ram&#x2019;s horn used as a musical instrument. The modern <em>shoh&#xB7;phar&#x2B9; </em>is a hollow ram&#x2019;s horn about 36&#xA0;cm (14&#xA0;in.) long, straightened by heat but curved upward at the bell end. It has a separate mouthpiece to facilitate blowing. The <em>shoh&#xB7;phar&#x2B9; </em>of Bible times, it is thought, had no separate mouthpiece, and according to the Talmud, the ram&#x2019;s horn was not straightened but left crooked.The <em>shoh&#xB7;phar&#x2B9; </em>was basically used as a signaling instrument. It assembled the Israelite forces, sometimes sounded the &#x201C;alarm signal&#x201D; against a city to be attacked, and directed other maneuvers in warfare.

So when the Midianites heard the horns blown by everyone in Gideon&#x2019;s band of 300 men, &#x201C;the whole camp got on the run,&#x201D; terror stricken.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002080/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 7:15-22</a>.In addition to the horn&#x2019;s announcing every new moon, it proclaimed the year of Jubilee and added to the joyful spirit of other occasions.
