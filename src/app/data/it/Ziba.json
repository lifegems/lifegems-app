David brought Mephibosheth to Jerusalem and assigned Ziba, his 15 sons, and his 20 servants to care for Mephibosheth&#x2019;s inheritance.

However, he left Mephibosheth behind, even though he wanted to come, and told David that Mephibosheth deliberately stayed in Jerusalem, expecting to recover the kingdom for Saul&#x2019;s house. In response, without further investigation of the matter David transferred Mephibosheth&#x2019;s property to Ziba.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004724/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 16:1-4</a>.When David returned after the rebellion was crushed, Ziba was among the early ones to greet the king. Then Mephibosheth met David, welcomed him back, and informed him of Ziba&#x2019;s trickery and slander. In the light of these new developments, David now decided that the property should be divided between Mephibosheth and Ziba. Mephibosheth, however, declared: &#x201C;Let him [Ziba] even take the whole, now that my lord the king has come in peace to his house.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004724/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 19:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004724/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 24-30</a>."}
