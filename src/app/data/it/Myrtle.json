It is capable of reaching a height of 9&#xA0;m (30&#xA0;ft) but is usually found as a shrub 2 to 3&#xA0;m (7 to 10&#xA0;ft) high. An evergreen, it is quite bushy in branch structure and has thick, shiny, dark-green leaves; it blossoms with clusters of fragrant white flowers that mature into blue-black berries. Almost the entire plant has a fragrant spicy oil used in perfumes. The berries, though aromatic, are edible. The myrtle is found today particularly in Upper Galilee and the valley of the Jordan, but it also grows in the Jerusalem area, as it evidently did at the time of Zechariah&#x2019;s vision recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003144/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Zechariah 1:8-11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003144/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;16</a>.Fragrant branches of myrtle were used along with the branches of other trees to cover the temporary outdoor huts or booths used by the Hebrews during the Festival of Booths.
