Jesus felt such a deep affection for his friend Lazarus, so that he &#x201C;gave way to tears&#x201D; in connection with the death of Lazarus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 11:35,&#xA0;36</a>) The same expression is used to show the strong, warm, personal attachment Jehovah has for his Son and for his Son&#x2019;s followers, as well as the warm feeling of the disciples for God&#x2019;s Son.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 5:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:27</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 16:22</a>.It is to be noted that there is a distinction between the Greek verbs <em>phi&#xB7;le&#x2B9;o </em>and <em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pa&#x2B9;o, </em>although many translators do not differentiate between these words. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/0\">LOVE</a>.) Regarding the difference between these words, F.&#xA0;Zorell (<em>Lexicon Graecum Novi Testamenti, </em>Paris, 1961, col. 1402) says: &#x201C;[<em>A&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pa&#x2B9;o</em>] signifies a kind of love for someone or something occasioned freely and of our own accord because of clearly perceived reasons; [<em>phi&#xB7;le&#x2B9;o</em>] differs from this in that it indicates a tender and affectionate kind of love such as arises spontaneously in our souls towards relatives or friends, and towards things we deem delightful.&#x201D;The use of these two verbs in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">John 21</a> is worthy of note. Twice Jesus asked Peter if he loved him, using the verb <em>a&#xB7;ga&#xB7;pa&#x2B9;o. </em>Both times Peter earnestly affirmed that he had affection for Jesus, using the more intimate word <em>phi&#xB7;le&#x2B9;o. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 21:15,&#xA0;16</a>) Finally, Jesus asked: &#x201C;Do you have affection for me?&#x201D; And Peter again asserted that he did. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 21:17</a>) Thus, Peter affirmed his warm, personal attachment for Jesus.Brotherly love (Gr., <em>phi&#xB7;la&#xB7;del&#xB7;phi&#x2B9;a, </em>literally, &#x201C;affection for a brother&#x201D;) should exist among all members of the Christian congregation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 12:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 13:1</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:8</a>.) Thus, the relationships within the congregation should be as close, strong, and warm as in a natural family. Even though the members of the congregation already show brotherly love, they are urged to do it in fuller measure.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 4:9,&#xA0;10</a>.The Greek word <em>phi&#xB7;lo&#x2B9;stor&#xB7;gos, </em>meaning &#x201C;having tender affection,&#x201D; is used of a person who is close to another in warm intimacy. One of the roots of this compound term, <em>ster&#x2B9;go, </em>is frequently used to denote a natural affection, as between family members. The apostle Paul encouraged Christians to cultivate this quality. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 12:10</a>) Paul also indicated that the last days would be characterized by people &#x201C;having no natural affection&#x201D; (Gr., <em>a&#x2B9;stor&#xB7;goi</em>) and that such persons are deserving of death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 3:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 1:31,&#xA0;32</a>.The Greek noun <em>phi&#xB7;li&#x2B9;a </em>(friendship) is found only once in the Christian Greek Scriptures, where James warns that &#x201C;the friendship with the world is enmity with God .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend [Gr., <em>phi&#x2B9;los</em>] of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000128/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 4:4</a>.<strong>Fondness for Money. </strong>One may develop a love of money (Gr., <em>phi&#xB7;lar&#xB7;gy&#xB7;ri&#x2B9;a, </em>literally, &#x201C;fondness of silver&#x201D;) and cause much damage to himself.
