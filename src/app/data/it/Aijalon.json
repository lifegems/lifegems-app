The village at this site is now called Yalo and is situated just N of the road from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv-Yafo, about 21&#xA0;km (13&#xA0;mi) WNW of Jerusalem.The Valley of Aijalon is the northernmost of several valleys cutting across the hills of the Shephelah and was an important pass leading from the coastal plains up into the central mountainous region. Joshua was evidently near this plain when he called for the sun and the moon to stand &#x201C;motionless&#x201D; over Gibeon and over &#x201C;the low plain of Aijalon,&#x201D; when he was completing his victorious battle against the five Amorite kings who had warred against Gibeon.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000182/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:40-42</a>) It was later <span id=\"page68\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"68\" data-before-text=\"68\"></span>assigned to the sons of Kohath as a Levite city.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000182/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 21:24</a>.The Danites at first proved unable to oust the Amorites from Aijalon, but it appears that Ephraim from the N came to their aid and &#x201C;the hand of the house of Joseph got to be so heavy that they [the Amorites] were forced into task work.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000182/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:34,&#xA0;35</a>) This may be the reason <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000182/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 6:69</a> lists Aijalon as belonging to Ephraim and as given by them to the Kohathites.

Later on, perhaps after the division of the kingdom, it is spoken of as the city of certain prominent Benjamites.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000182/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 8:13</a>.At Aijalon, Saul won his first victory over the Philistines, when Israel &#x201C;kept striking down the [fleeing] Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000182/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 14:31</a>) Many years after that, when the kingdom had been divided after King Solomon&#x2019;s death (c.&#xA0;998&#xA0;B.C.E.), his son and successor Rehoboam fortified Aijalon and made it one of his strongholds against the N and W.
