While the term &#x201C;Arabah&#x201D; is applied to the entire Rift Valley region from the Sea of Galilee on down to the Red Sea, here it has particular application to the area from S of the Dead Sea down to the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba. Thus, while the expression &#x201C;torrent valley of the Arabah&#x201D; might have reference to a wadi such as the torrent valley of Zered, which empties into the S end of the Dead Sea (&#x201C;the sea of the Arabah,&#x201D; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000326/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">De 3:17</a>), it is notable that the expression used by Amos is the exact equivalent of the Arabic name applied to the region running from the S end of the Dead Sea to the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba, namely &#x201C;Wadi el-&#x2BD;Arabah.&#x201D; Amos&#x2019; prophecy indicated a complete overrunning of the entire land once controlled by Judah and Israel, from N to S.&#xA0;During the following century this prophecy saw fulfillment in the invasions of Assyrian kings, including Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III, Shalmaneser&#xA0;V, Sargon&#xA0;II, and Sennacherib."}
