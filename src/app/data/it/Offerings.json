In the first recorded instance, Adam&#x2019;s oldest son Cain presented some fruits of the ground, and Adam&#x2019;s younger son Abel, the firstlings of his flock. Evidently the attitudes and motives of the two brothers were different, for God approved Abel&#x2019;s offering but looked with disfavor on Cain&#x2019;s. (Later, the Law covenant provided for both animal and grain offerings.) Abel must have had faith in God&#x2019;s promise of liberation through the promised Seed and likely realized that blood would have to be shed, someone would have to be &#x2018;bruised in the heel,&#x2019; so that mankind might be uplifted to the perfection that Adam and Eve had lost.

This act of Abraham foreshadowed Jehovah&#x2019;s offering of his own only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003298/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:1-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003298/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 11:17-19</a>.<strong>Under the Law. </strong>The sacrifices commanded under the Law covenant all pointed forward to Jesus Christ and his sacrifice or to benefits that flow from that sacrifice.

The worshiper and his household partook (in the courtyard of the tabernacle; according to tradition, booths were set up around the inside of the curtain surrounding the courtyard; in the temple, dining rooms were provided). The officiating priest received a portion, and the priests on duty, another portion. Jehovah, in effect, received the pleasing smoke of the burning fat. The blood, representing the life, was given to God as his. Therefore the priests, the worshipers, and Jehovah were as if together at the meal, signifying peaceful relationships. The person partaking while in a state of uncleanness (any of the uncleannesses mentioned in the Law) or who ate the flesh after it had been kept beyond the prescribed time (in the warm climate it would begin to putrefy) was to be cut off from his people. He defiled or desecrated the meal, because of either being unclean himself or eating that which was foul before Jehovah God, showing disrespect for sacred things.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003298/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Le 7:16-21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003298/29/1\" data-bid=\"30-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:5-8</a>.The Lord&#x2019;s Evening Meal (Memorial or Last Supper) is a communion meal.

They share also with Jehovah as Author of the arrangement. These are seeking Jehovah&#x2019;s approval and are at peace not only with one another but also with Jehovah through Jesus Christ. In line with the requirement of cleanness for sharers in a communion meal, Paul warns that the Christian should examine himself before the Memorial meal. To treat the occasion or the emblems of wine and unleavened bread lightly or with contempt would be desecration of sacred things, meriting adverse judgment.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003298/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 11:25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003298/31/1\" data-bid=\"32-2\" class=\"b\"> 27-29</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003298/2\">LORD&#x2019;S EVENING MEAL</a>.In the <em>thanksgiving offering, </em>which was a communion offering praising God for his provisions and loving-kindnesses, flesh and both leavened and unleavened bread were eaten.
