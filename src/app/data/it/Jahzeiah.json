According to the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>and Latin <em>Vulgate, </em>Jahzeiah and the others assisted rather than opposed Ezra. Hence, an alternate rendering of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002300/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ezra 10:15</a> says that Jonathan and Jahzeiah &#x201C;were the ones that acted representatively in this behalf.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>NW </em>ftn; see also <em>KJ; AS, </em>ftn; <em>Dy; Kx.</em>"}
