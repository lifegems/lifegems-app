Common millet is distinguished by its broad leaves and its bristly, extensively branched panicles, or clusters of seeds. The stalks of the plant are commonly fed to livestock, and its tiny seeds, of which there are many in each panicle, are still used in the Middle East for making bread, usually in combination with other cereals.
