According to the <em>Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, che&#x2B9;sedh </em>&#x201C;is active, social, and enduring. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. [<em>Che&#x2B9;sedh</em>] always designates not just a human attitude, but also the act that emerges from this attitude. It is an act that preserves or promotes life. It is intervention on behalf of someone suffering misfortune or distress. It is demonstration of friendship or piety.

Incidental acts of kindness may reflect customary hospitality or a tendency toward warmheartedness, yet may not necessarily indicate godliness. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 27:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/62/1\" data-bid=\"63-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/62/2\" data-bid=\"63-3\" class=\"b\"> 28:1,&#xA0;2</a>.) In the case of a certain man belonging to the city of Bethel, the kindness offered him really was in payment for favors expected of him in return.

The word &#x201C;grace,&#x201D; however, with some 14 different meanings does not convey to most readers the ideas contained in the Greek word. To illustrate: In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/77/0\" data-bid=\"78-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:14</a>, where the <em>King James Version </em>says &#x201C;the Word was made flesh .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. full of grace and truth,&#x201D; what is meant? Does it mean &#x201C;gracefulness,&#x201D; or &#x201C;favor,&#x201D; or what?Scholar R.&#xA0;C.&#xA0;Trench, in <em>Synonyms of the New Testament, </em>says <em>kha&#x2B9;ris </em>implies &#x201C;a favour freely done, without claim or expectation of return<wbr>&#x2014;the word being thus predisposed to receive its new emphasis [as given it in the Christian writings]&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;, to set forth the entire and absolute freeness of the loving-kindness of God to men. Thus Aristotle, defining [<em>kha&#x2B9;ris</em>], lays the whole stress on this very point, that it is conferred freely, with no expectation of return, and finding its only motive in the bounty and free-heartedness of the giver.&#x201D; (London, 1961, p.&#xA0;158) Joseph H.&#xA0;Thayer in his lexicon says: &#x201C;The word [<em>kha&#x2B9;ris</em>] contains the idea of <em>kindness which bestows upon one what he has not deserved </em>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. the N. T. writers use [<em>kha&#x2B9;ris</em>] pre-eminently of that kindness by which God bestows favors even upon the ill-deserving, and grants to sinners the pardon of their offences, and bids them accept of eternal salvation through Christ.&#x201D; (<em>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, </em>1889, p.&#xA0;666) <em>Kha&#x2B9;ris </em>is closely related to another Greek word, <em>kha&#x2B9;ri&#xB7;sma, </em>concerning which William Barclay&#x2019;s <em>New Testament Wordbook </em>(1956, p.&#xA0;29) says: &#x201C;The whole basic idea of the word [<em>kha&#x2B9;ri&#xB7;sma</em>] is that of a free and undeserved gift, of something given to a man unearned and unmerited.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/78/0\" data-bid=\"79-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 1:11</a>, <em>Int.</em>When <em>kha&#x2B9;ris </em>is used in the above sense, in reference to kindness bestowed on one who does not deserve it, as is true with the kindnesses extended by Jehovah, &#x201C;undeserved kindness&#x201D; is a very good English equivalent for the Greek expression.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/79/0\" data-bid=\"80-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 15:40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/79/1\" data-bid=\"80-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/79/2\" data-bid=\"80-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 4:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/79/3\" data-bid=\"80-4\" class=\"b\"> 5:10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002612/79/4\" data-bid=\"80-5\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;12</a>.A worker is entitled to what he has worked for, his pay; he expects his wages as a right, as a debt owed him, and payment of it is no gift or special undeserved kindness.
