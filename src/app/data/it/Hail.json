The Bible&#x2019;s references to the destructive nature of hail are confirmed by what has happened in different parts of the earth in more recent years. In 1985, a hailstorm in Brazil killed more than 20 persons and injured another 300. Severe thunderstorms can generate hail the size of eggs or even grapefruit. An unusually large hailstone picked up after a storm in Kansas (U.S.A.) on September&#xA0;3, 1970, measured some 15&#xA0;cm (6&#xA0;in.) across. The large stones fall at speeds of about 160&#xA0;km/<wbr>hr (100&#xA0;mph). Hail is particularly damaging to crops, with single hailstorms sometimes causing losses amounting to millions of dollars.<strong>Used by Jehovah. </strong>Hail is one of the forces Jehovah has used at times to accomplish his word and to demonstrate his great power.

On this occasion more died from the hailstones than in battle with Israel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001820/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 10:3-7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001820/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;11</a>.<strong><em>Symbolic. </em></strong>Jehovah, however, did not spare unfaithful Israel from devastating hail.
