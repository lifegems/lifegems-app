(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 7:17</a>.) A form of the word <em>quts </em>has been translated &#x201C;feel a sickening dread&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 1:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Nu 22:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 7:16</a>), and this term often conveys the sense of &#x201C;abhorrence.&#x201D; (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/0\">ABHORRENT THING</a>.)

That Jacob shared the viewpoint of his father Isaac is shown by his making an oath &#x201C;by the Dread of his father Isaac.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 31:42,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;53</a>.A wholesome dread of Jehovah, reflected in a desire to shun what He disapproves, is vital if a person is to remain his servant. This dread made it possible for Job to be blameless and upright. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 23:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 31:23</a>) And it enabled the psalmist to persevere in a divinely favored course despite the persecution by princes.

So there is no reason for one to be in dread of men, manifesting intense fear of what they might do, and so yield to their improper demands.

At times they do find themselves in a pitiable, disadvantaged position. Not discerning that such ones are still the objects of Jehovah&#x2019;s care, faithless persons may abandon them in dread, not wanting to share their seemingly hopeless lot. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 31:11</a>) But Jehovah will not forsake them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 27:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001221/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 94:14</a>.It is because of having no dread of God that the wicked continue in their evil ways.
