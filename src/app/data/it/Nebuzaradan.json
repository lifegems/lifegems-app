It does not appear that Nebuzaradan was present during the initial siege and breakthrough of Jerusalem, for it was about a month later that he &#x201C;came to Jerusalem,&#x201D; after King Zedekiah had been brought to Nebuchadnezzar and blinded.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003202/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 25:2-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003202/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 39:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003202/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 52:6-11</a>.From outside the city, Nebuzaradan directed the Babylonian operations of destroying the city, which began &#x201C;on the seventh day of the month&#x201D; (the fifth month, Ab), and which included looting the temple treasures, wrecking the wall, dealing with the captives, and allowing some of the lowly ones to remain.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003202/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 52:12,&#xA0;13</a>) Josephus observed that it was on the very same day, the <em>tenth </em>day of the fifth month, when Solomon&#x2019;s temple was burned, that the temple rebuilt by Herod was also burned, in 70&#xA0;C.E.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Jewish War, </em>VI, 250 (iv,&#xA0;5);&#xA0;VI, 268 (iv,&#xA0;8); see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003202/0\">AB</a>.Nebuzaradan, under orders from Nebuchadnezzar, released Jeremiah and spoke to him kindly, letting him choose what he would do, offering to look after him and granting him some supplies. Nebuzaradan was also spokesman for the king of Babylon in appointing Gedaliah governor over those remaining.
