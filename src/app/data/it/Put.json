(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 1:8</a>) Although Put is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, none of his individual offspring are named. Often his descendants lent military support to Egypt. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 46:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Eze 30:4-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Na 3:9</a>) They served as mercenaries in the armies of Tyre and contributed to that city&#x2019;s greatness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;10</a>) It was also foretold that Put would be among the forces of Gog of Magog.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 38:5</a>.Available evidence points to a connection between Put and the Libyans of N Africa. In three of its occurrences, &#x201C;Put&#x201D; is rendered &#x201C;Libyans&#x201D; by the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>and the Latin <em>Vulgate. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 46:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Eze 27:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 38:5</a>) The Hebrew &#x201C;Put&#x201D; also corresponds closely to the <em>put</em>[<em>i</em>]<em>ja </em>(usually considered to be Libya) of Old Persian inscriptions. However, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003591/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Nahum 3:9</a> seems to indicate that Put and the <em>Lu&#xB7;vim&#x2B9; </em>(Libyans) are separate peoples. But this in itself would not rule out identifying Put with the Libyans. The term &#x201C;Libyans&#x201D; was perhaps more comprehensive than the Hebrew designation <em>Lu&#xB7;vim&#x2B9;, </em>as may be deduced from the reference made by Herodotus (II,&#xA0;32) to &#x201C;Libyans, many tribes of them.&#x201D;The identification of Put with the &#x201C;Punt&#x201D; of Egyptian inscriptions is not generally accepted today for phonetic reasons."}
