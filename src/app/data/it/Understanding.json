Professor R.&#xA0;C.&#xA0;Dentan, writing in <em>The Interpreter&#x2019;s Dictionary of the Bible </em>(edited by G.&#xA0;Buttrick, 1962, Vol.&#xA0;4, p.&#xA0;733), says: &#x201C;The root &#x5D1;&#x5D9;&#x5DF; [<em>bin</em>] means primarily &#x2018;to discern with the senses,&#x2019; &#x2018;to perceive distinctions,&#x2019; then &#x2018;to give close attention to,&#x2019; and finally<wbr>&#x2014;particularly in the derived stems&#x2014;<wbr>&#x2018;to gain comprehension&#x2019; or &#x2018;give&#x2019; it to others.&#x201D; Hebrew scholar Gesenius gives the basic sense as <em>&#x201C;to separate, to distinguish; </em>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. hence <em>to discern, to mark, to understand, </em>all [of] which depend on the power of separating, distinguishing, discriminating.&#x201D; (<em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, </em>translated by E.&#xA0;Robinson, 1836, p.&#xA0;140) Another noun, <em>tevu&#xB7;nah&#x2B9;, </em>comes from the same root as <em>bi&#xB7;nah&#x2B9; </em>and may be appropriately rendered &#x201C;discernment&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 10:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:12</a>) or &#x201C;understanding&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 31:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> De 32:28</a>), according to the context.The basic meaning of these terms reveals the understanding person to be one able to see into a matter and discern its composition by separating the individual factors or features that compose or act together to form the whole, then to perceive the relationship between them and thus comprehend, or grasp, the significance or meaning of the matter. This may be illustrated with a language. If a person is to understand what is spoken in a certain tongue, he must be able to distinguish the individual words composing the sentences, know their meaning, and see how they relate to one another. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">De 28:49</a>) However, even though a person may basically comprehend what is said to him, understanding can also go beyond such simple comprehension; it means that he gets the real significance and sense of the message, then is able to evaluate it, benefit by it, and know what action it calls for. When Ezra the priest read the Law before the people in Jerusalem, &#x201C;all intelligent [from Heb., <em>bin</em>] enough to listen&#x201D; were gathered. Even though these had mature minds able to understand all the words, the Levites &#x201C;were explaining the law to the people [instructing the people in the law, or giving understanding (form of <em>bin</em>)], .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning into it; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 8:2, 3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 7,&#xA0;8</a>.In the Greek Scriptures, &#x201C;understanding,&#x201D; as signifying perception, getting the sense of a matter, is represented especially by the verb <em>sy&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;e&#xB7;mi </em>(literally, put together) and the related noun <em>sy&#x2B9;ne&#xB7;sis. </em>Other terms are <em>e&#xB7;pi&#x2B9;sta&#xB7;mai, </em>meaning, basically, &#x201C;know well,&#x201D; and <em>gi&#xB7;no&#x2B9;sko, </em>meaning &#x201C;know.&#x201D;<strong>Source of Understanding. </strong>Jehovah God is both the Source of understanding and the Supreme Example of its use.
