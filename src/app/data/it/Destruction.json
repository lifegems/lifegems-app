This is demonstrated by the fact that the Hebrew word <em>&#x2BC;avad&#xB7;dohn&#x2B9; </em>(destruction) is used twice to parallel &#x201C;Sheol.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Job 26:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 15:11</a>) The prophet Zephaniah spoke of the destruction of Assyria, whereas Ezekiel said that the Assyrians would go down to Sheol.

Jesus implied this when he spoke of &#x201C;those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 20:35</a>) The possibility of eternal destruction for some is also indicated by Jesus&#x2019; words at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 10:28</a>: &#x201C;Do not become fearful of those who kill <span id=\"page617\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"617\" data-before-text=\"617\"></span>the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.&#x201D; Regarding this text, <em>The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology </em>(edited by C.&#xA0;Brown, 1978, Vol.&#xA0;3, p.&#xA0;304) states: &#x201C;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Matt. 10:28</a> teaches not the potential immortality of the soul but the irreversibility of divine judgment on the unrepentant.&#x201D; Also, Bauer&#x2019;s <em>Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament </em>(revised by F.&#xA0;W.&#xA0;Gingrich and F.&#xA0;Danker, 1979, p.&#xA0;95) gives the meaning &#x201C;eternal death&#x201D; with reference to the Greek phrase in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 10:28</a> translated &#x201C;destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.&#x201D; Thus, being consigned to Gehenna refers to utter destruction from which no resurrection is possible.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/4\">GEHENNA</a>.&#x201C;Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. are placed before us as a warning example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Jude&#xA0;7</a>) That punishment evidently applies not merely to the physical cities but to their inhabitants as well, because it was the people themselves who committed the gross sins that led to their annihilation.The possibility of eternal destruction is particularly an issue during the conclusion of the system of things. When Jesus was asked by his disciples what would be &#x2018;the sign of his presence and of the conclusion of the system of things,&#x2019; he included as part of his answer the parable of the sheep and the goats. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 25:31-46</a>) Concerning &#x201C;the goats&#x201D; it was foretold that the heavenly King would say: &#x201C;Be on your way from me, you who have been cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels,&#x201D; and Jesus added, &#x201C;These will depart into everlasting cutting-off.&#x201D; Clearly the attitude and actions of some individuals will result in their permanent destruction.However, Jehovah &#x201C;does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 3:9</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 18:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;32</a>.) In fact, Jehovah loved humans so much that he provided the ransom sacrifice of his own Son, Jesus Christ.

Despite this loving provision, the majority refuse to follow &#x201C;the road leading off into life,&#x201D; but they remain on &#x201C;the road leading off into destruction.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:13,&#xA0;14</a>.The Bible indicates that a number of things, individuals, and organizations are to be everlastingly destroyed.

The same is true of those who blaspheme the holy spirit. They are guilty of &#x201C;everlasting sin&#x201D; and are forgiven neither &#x201C;in this system of things nor in that to come.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 3:28, 29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 12:32</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/5\">BLASPHEMY</a>.)
