Probably covering a period of more than 20 years (1473-c.&#xA0;1450&#xA0;B.C.E.), it tells of the conquest of Canaan, followed by the distribution of the land to the Israelites; and it concludes with Joshua&#x2019;s discourses encouraging faithfulness to Jehovah.The fact that the book contains ancient names for cities (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 14:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:15</a>) and detailed instructions and then relates how these were carried out indicates that it is a contemporary record. (For <span id=\"page116\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"116\" data-before-text=\"116\"></span>examples see <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 1:11-18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:14-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 3:2&#x2013;4:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> 6:22,&#xA0;23</a>.) In fact, the writer identifies himself as living at the same time as Rahab of Jericho and therefore as an eyewitness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">6:25</a>.<strong>Authenticity. </strong>In the estimation of some, however, the book of Joshua is not true history. This view is primarily based on the assumption that, since the miracles mentioned in the book are foreign to recent human experience, they could not have happened. It therefore calls into question God&#x2019;s ability to perform miracles, if not also his existence, as well as the writer&#x2019;s integrity. For the writer to have embellished his account with fiction while presenting himself as an eyewitness would have made him guilty of deliberate deceit. Surely it is illogical to conclude that a book that honors God as the Fulfiller of his word (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 21:43-45</a>), encourages faithfulness to him (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">23:6-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 24:14, 15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 19, 20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>), <span id=\"page117\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"117\" data-before-text=\"117\"></span>and openly acknowledges Israel&#x2019;s failures was produced by a false witness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">7:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:3</a>.No one can deny that the Israelite nation came into existence and occupied the land described in the book of Joshua. Likewise, there is no valid basis for challenging the truthfulness of that book&#x2019;s account concerning the way in which the Israelites gained possession of Canaan.

Their main objection is that some of the events recorded in the book of Joshua also appear in the book of Judges, which commences with the words, &#x201C;And after the death of Joshua.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:1</a>) Nevertheless, this opening statement is not necessarily a time indicator for all the events found in the Judges account. The book is not arranged in strict chronological order, for it mentions an event that definitely is placed before Joshua&#x2019;s death. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 2:6-9</a>) Therefore, some things, such as the capture of Hebron by Caleb (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:9,&#xA0;10</a>), Debir by Othniel (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:15-19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:11-15</a>), and Leshem, or Laish (Dan), by the Danites (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:47, 48;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 18:27-29</a>), could likewise have taken place before Joshua&#x2019;s death. Even the action of the Danites in setting up an idolatrous image at Laish could reasonably fit Joshua&#x2019;s time. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 18:30,&#xA0;31</a>) In his concluding exhortation, Joshua told the Israelites: &#x201C;Remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 24:14</a>) Had idolatry not existed, this statement would have had little meaning.Logically, then, with the exception of the concluding portion that reports his death, the book may be attributed to Joshua. As Moses had recorded the happenings of his lifetime, so it would have been fitting for Joshua to do likewise. The book itself reports: &#x201C;Then Joshua wrote these words in the book of God&#x2019;s law.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 24:26</a>.<strong>Not Contradictory. </strong>Some have felt that the book is contradictory in making it appear that the land was completely subdued by Joshua while at the same time reporting that much of it remained to be taken. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 11:16, 17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/21/1\" data-bid=\"22-2\" class=\"b\"> 23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002524/21/2\" data-bid=\"22-3\" class=\"b\"> 13:1</a>.) But such seeming discrepancies are easily resolved when one bears in mind that there were two distinct aspects in the conquest. First, national warfare under Joshua&#x2019;s leadership broke the power of the Canaanites. Next, individual and tribal action was required to take full possession of the land.
