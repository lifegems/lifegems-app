Because of this some scholars suggest that &#x201C;Agag&#x201D; was a title used by the kings of the Amalekites similar to the title of Pharaoh used by the kings of Egypt. It may also be simply a case of the repeated use of a personal name. At any rate the manner of Balaam&#x2019;s reference to Agag indicates that his kingdom was at that time a powerful one.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000130/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 24:20</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000130/0\">AMALEK, AMALEKITES</a>.<strong>2. </strong>The king of Amalek who was defeated by King Saul in fulfillment of Jehovah&#x2019;s decree.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000130/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 15:8-29</a>) Agag was then executed by Samuel, who told him: &#x201C;Just as your sword has bereaved women of children, in that way your mother will be most bereaved of children among women.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000130/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 15:32, 33</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000130/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:5-7</a>."}
