This, in turn, made them objects of hatred and persecution, which was instigated chiefly by the false religious leaders and misinformed political rulers. Their leader Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, had been put to death on the charge of sedition; now peace-loving Christians were accused of &#x201C;disturbing our city,&#x201D; &#x2018;overturning the inhabited earth,&#x2019; and being a people &#x2018;that everywhere is spoken against.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000967/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 16:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000967/36/1\" data-bid=\"37-2\" class=\"b\"> 17:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000967/36/2\" data-bid=\"37-3\" class=\"b\"> 28:22</a>) By the time Peter wrote his first letter (c.&#xA0;62-64&#xA0;C.E.) it seems that the activity of Christians was well known in places such as &#x201C;Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000967/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:1</a>.<strong>Non-Christian Testimony. </strong>Secular writers of the first two centuries also acknowledged the presence and influence of early Christians in their pagan world. For example, Tacitus, a Roman historian born about 55&#xA0;C.E., tells of the rumor charging that Nero was the one responsible for burning Rome (64&#xA0;C.E.), and then says: &#x201C;Therefore, to scotch the rumour, Nero substituted as culprits, and punished with the utmost refinements of cruelty, a class of men, loathed for their vices [as the Romans viewed matters], whom the crowd styled Christians. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. First, then, the confessed members of the sect were arrested; next, on their disclosures, vast numbers were convicted, not so much on the count of arson as for hatred of the human race. And derision accompanied their end: they were covered with wild beasts&#x2019; skins and torn to death by dogs; or they were fastened on crosses, and, when daylight failed were burned to serve as lamps by night.&#x201D; (<em>The Annals, </em>XV, XLIV) Suetonius, another Roman historian, born toward the end of the first century C.E., relates events that occurred during Nero&#x2019;s reign, saying: &#x201C;Punishment was inflicted on the Christians, a class of men given to a new and mischievous superstition.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Lives of the Caesars </em>(Nero, XVI,&#xA0;2).Flavius Josephus, in his <em>Jewish Antiquities </em>(XVIII, 64 [iii,&#xA0;3]), mentions certain events in the life of Jesus, adding: &#x201C;And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day <span id=\"page442\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"442\" data-before-text=\"442\"></span>[about 93&#xA0;C.E.] not disappeared.&#x201D; Pliny the Younger, governor of Bithynia in 111 or 112&#xA0;C.E., faced with the &#x2018;Christian problem,&#x2019; wrote to Emperor Trajan, outlining the methods he was using and asking for advice. &#x201C;I have asked them in person if they are Christians,&#x201D; wrote Pliny. If they admitted it, they were punished. However, others &#x201C;denied that they were or ever had been Christians.&#x201D; Put to the test, not only did these offer up pagan sacrifices but they even &#x201C;reviled the name of Christ: none of which things, I understand, any genuine Christian can be induced to do.&#x201D; In answering this letter, Trajan commended Pliny on the way he had handled the matter: &#x201C;You have followed the right course of procedure .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. in your examination of the cases of persons charged with being Christians.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Letters of Pliny, </em>X, XCVI, 3,&#xA0;5; XCVII,&#xA0;1.First-century Christianity had no temples, built no altars, used no crucifixes, and sponsored no garbed and betitled ecclesiastics. Early Christians celebrated no state holidays and refused all military service. &#x201C;A careful review of all the information available goes to show that, until the time of Marcus Aurelius [who ruled 161-180&#xA0;C.E.], no Christian became a soldier; and no soldier, after becoming a Christian, remained in military service.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Rise of Christianity, </em>by E.&#xA0;Barnes, 1947, p.&#xA0;333.Nevertheless, as indicated in Pliny&#x2019;s letter, not all who bore the name Christian were uncompromisingly such when put to the test. Just as had been foretold, the spirit of apostasy was already at work before the apostles fell asleep.
