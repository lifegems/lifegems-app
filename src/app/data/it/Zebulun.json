Being the less-loved wife, Leah was especially pleased about the birth of the boy. The name she gave him reflected the hope that her standing with Jacob would be enhanced. Leah exclaimed: &#x201C;At last my husband will tolerate me, because I have borne him six sons.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004679/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 30:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004679/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 35:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004679/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Ex 1:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004679/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 2:1</a>) Zebulun eventually became the father of three sons<wbr>&#x2014;Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
