(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002886/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 13:15</a>.) The Hebrew term <em>&#x2BC;e&#xB7;vus&#x2B9; </em>is generally understood to mean &#x201C;manger&#x201D; and was rendered <em>phat&#x2B9;ne </em>in the Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>as were three other Hebrew words that have been translated &#x201C;stalls&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002886/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 32:28</a>), &#x201C;enclosures&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002886/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Hab 3:17</a>), and &#x201C;fodder&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002886/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Job 6:5</a>).In Palestine, archaeologists have found large troughs cut out of single pieces of limestone and measuring about 0.9&#xA0;m (3&#xA0;ft) in length, 0.5&#xA0;m (1.5&#xA0;ft) in width, and 0.6&#xA0;m (2&#xA0;ft) in depth. These are thought to have served as mangers. It may also be that, as in more recent times, mangers were cut in the rock walls of caves that were used for sheltering animals."}
