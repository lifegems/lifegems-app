{"title":"Official Garment","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003305","html":"<span id=\"page545\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"545\" data-before-text=\"545\"></span><strong>OFFICIAL GARMENT</strong>The Hebrew word <em>&#x2BC;ad&#xB7;de&#x2B9;reth </em>describes that which is &#x201C;majestic&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 17:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Zec 11:3</a>) and, in its references to a garment, evidently refers to a wide cloak or robe, perhaps worn over the shoulders and made of skins or of cloth woven from hair or wool.Evidence that the term describes a hairy garment is seen in the description of Isaac&#x2019;s firstborn Esau. At birth, he &#x201C;came out red all over like an official garment of hair; so they called his name Esau.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 25:25</a>) His resemblance to an official garment was likely not his reddish color but his hairiness.When translating <em>&#x2BC;ad&#xB7;de&#x2B9;reth, </em>for the official garment used by Elijah and Elisha, the <em>Septuagint </em>uses the Greek word <em>me&#xB7;lo&#xB7;te&#x2B9; </em>(meaning sheepskin or any rough woolly skin). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 19:13</a>) This suggests that the garment was made of skins with the hair left on, similar to the garb worn by certain Bedouin. Paul&#x2019;s description of persecuted servants of God who &#x201C;went about in sheepskins, in goatskins,&#x201D; may refer to the dress of such prophets of Jehovah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 11:37</a>) John the Baptizer wore clothing of camel hair, though it is not stated that this was his official garment as a prophet.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 1:6</a>.However designed, these official garments of hair appear to have been an identifying mark of certain prophets. When King Ahaziah heard the description of &#x201C;a man possessing a hair garment, with a leather belt girded about his loins,&#x201D; he immediately recognized that it was the prophet Elijah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 1:8</a>) This official garment served as the anointing instrument that was thrown upon Elisha when he was &#x2018;called&#x2019; to leave the plow and follow Elijah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 19:19-21</a>) Later, at the time Elijah went up in the windstorm, this garment was left for his successor, who soon used it in dividing the Jordan River, just as his master had done. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 2:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 13,&#xA0;14</a>) False prophets, it appears, sometimes wore similar garments of hair to deceive the people into accepting them as reputable prophets of Jehovah, thus making their messages seem more credible.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 13:4</a>.The term <em>&#x2BC;ad&#xB7;de&#x2B9;reth </em>was also used in reference to costly and royal garments, like the one stolen by Achan, &#x201C;an official garment from Shinar, a good-looking one.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 7:21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;24</a>) Ancient Babylon, or Shinar, was noted for its beautiful robes. The king of Nineveh &#x201C;put off his official garment,&#x201D; undoubtedly a splendid robe, and clothed himself with sackcloth to show his repentance.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003305/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Jon 3:6</a>."}
