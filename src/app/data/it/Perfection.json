That is, a thing is &#x201C;perfect&#x201D; according to, or in relation to, the purpose or end for which it is appointed by its designer or producer, or the use to which it is to be put by its receiver or user. The very meaning of perfection requires that there be someone who decides when &#x201C;completion&#x201D; has been reached, what the standards of excellence are, what requirements are to be satisfied, and what details are essential. Ultimately, God the Creator is the final Arbiter of perfection, the Standard-Setter, in accord with his own righteous purposes and interests.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 12:2</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/0\">JEHOVAH</a> (A God of moral standards).As an illustration, the planet Earth was one of God&#x2019;s creations, and at the end of six creative &#x2018;days&#x2019; of work toward it, God pronounced the results &#x201C;very good.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:31</a>) It met his supreme standards of excellence, hence it was perfect.

Yet when God&#x2019;s purpose concerning it was accomplished, it ceased to be used and passed out of existence. The perfection of that which it represented was of a far higher type.The city of Jerusalem with its hill of Zion was called &#x201C;the perfection of prettiness.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">La 2:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 50:2</a>) This does not mean that every minute aspect of the city&#x2019;s physical appearance was supremely attractive, but rather, it relates to its use by God, the city&#x2019;s beauty resulting from the splendor that he conferred upon it, making it the capital of his anointed kings and the site of his temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 16:14</a>) The wealthy commercial city of Tyre is portrayed as a ship whose builders, those working in behalf of the city&#x2019;s material interests, had &#x2018;perfected its prettiness,&#x2019; filling it with luxury products of many lands.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:3-25</a>.Thus, in each case the context must be considered to determine in what sense or relation perfection is meant.<strong>Perfection of the Mosaic Law. </strong>The Law given to Israel through Moses included among its provisions the establishment of a priesthood and the offering of various animal sacrifices. Though from God, and hence perfect, neither the Law, its priesthood, nor the sacrifices brought perfection to those under the Law, as the inspired apostle shows. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> 10:1</a>) Rather than bring freedom from sin and death, it actually made sin more evident.

Although the offering of sacrifices through the Aaronic priesthood maintained a right standing for the people before God, it did not completely or perfectly relieve them of consciousness of sin. The apostle refers to this in saying that the atonement sacrifices could not &#x201C;make those who approach perfect,&#x201D; that is, as regards their conscience. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:1-4</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 9:9</a>.) The high priest was unable to provide the ransom price needed for a true redemption from sin.

Some critical persons may insist that, to be perfect, the Bible should be free of even superficial differences or what appear, according to their standards, to be inconsistencies. None of these things, however, detract from the perfection of the Sacred Scriptures. For the real gauge of its perfection is its measuring up to the standards of excellence set by Jehovah God, its accomplishing the end or purpose that he, as its true Author, appointed for it, as well as its being free from falsehood, as the published Word of the God of truth. The apostle Paul points up the perfection of &#x201C;the holy writings&#x201D; in saying: &#x201C;All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 3:15-17</a>) What the Hebrew Scriptures did for the nation of Israel when they observed them, what the completed Scriptures did for the Christian congregation in the first century, and what the Bible can do for persons in the present, is convincing proof of its qualities as an ideal instrument of God to accomplish his purpose.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 1:18</a>.The whole tenor of the Scriptures, including the teachings of God&#x2019;s Son, is to the effect that the gaining of understanding of God&#x2019;s purposes, the doing of his will, and the attaining of salvation to life are dependent primarily upon the individual&#x2019;s heart.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 4:12,&#xA0;13</a>) It is clear from the Scriptures that God has not made knowledge of himself something to be acquired without effort. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 2:1-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\"> 8:32-36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/37/2\" data-bid=\"38-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 55:6-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/37/3\" data-bid=\"38-4\" class=\"b\"> Mt 7:7,&#xA0;8</a>.) It is also evident that God has caused his purposes to be revealed to humble ones and hidden from haughty ones, because &#x2018;to do thus came to be the way approved by him.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 11:25-27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> 13:10-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/38/2\" data-bid=\"39-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 2:6-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/38/3\" data-bid=\"39-4\" class=\"b\"> Jas 4:6</a>) So, the fact that individuals whose hearts do not respond to the Bible&#x2019;s message can find things in the Scriptures that, in their opinion, justify their rejection of its message, its reproof, and its discipline does not show any imperfection on the part of the Bible. Rather, it illustrates the Scriptural points just made and hence demonstrates the perfection of the Bible in the view of its Author, whose view alone is decisive.

The individual may feel that certain details and explanations should be in the Bible, revealing why, in specific cases, God gave approval or disapproval or why he took a particular course of action; the individual also may feel that other details found in the Bible are superfluous. Yet he should realize that if the Bible conformed to human standards or criteria, such as his own, this would not prove it divinely perfect. Exposing the falsity of such an attitude, Jehovah declares the superiority of his thoughts and ways to those of humans, and <span id=\"page604\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"604\" data-before-text=\"604\"></span>he assures that his word will &#x201C;have certain success&#x201D; in the fulfillment of his purpose.

To view this as incompatible with perfection is to ignore the meaning of the term, substituting a personal concept that goes contrary to fact. God&#x2019;s intelligent creatures are granted free moral agency, the privilege and responsibility of making a personal decision as to the course they will take.

If Adam and his wife had <em>lacked </em>the ability to choose in this matter, they would not have met God&#x2019;s requirements; they would not have been complete, perfect, according to his standards.It must be remembered that perfection as it relates to humans is a relative perfection, limited to the human sphere. Though created perfect, Adam could not go beyond the limits assigned him by his Creator; he could not eat dirt, gravel, or wood without suffering ill effects; if he tried to breathe water instead of air, he would drown. Similarly, if he allowed his mind and heart to feed on wrong thoughts, this would lead to entertaining wrong desires and finally bring sin and death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 1:14, 15</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 4:4</a>.That the creature&#x2019;s individual will and choice are determining factors readily becomes evident. If we were to insist that a perfect man could not take a wrong course where a moral issue was involved, should we not also logically argue that an <em>imperfect </em>creature could not take a <em>right </em>course where such moral issue was involved? Yet some imperfect creatures <em>do </em>take a right course on moral issues involving obedience to God, even choosing to suffer persecution rather than change from such a course; while at the same time others deliberately engage in doing what they know is wrong. Thus not all wrong actions can be excused by human imperfection. The individual&#x2019;s will and choice are deciding factors. In the same way, it was not human perfection alone that would guarantee right action by the first man but, rather, the exercise of his own free will and choice as motivated by love for his God and for what was right.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 4:23</a>.<strong><em>The first sinner and the king of Tyre. </em></strong>Human sin and imperfection were, of course, preceded by sin and imperfection in the spirit realm, as Jesus&#x2019; words at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">John 8:44</a> and the account in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">chapter&#xA0;3 of Genesis</a> reveal.

In that case, the reference may be to the early course of friendship and cooperation followed by the Tyrian rulership during the reigns of Kings David and Solomon, when Tyre even contributed toward the building of Jehovah&#x2019;s temple on Mount Moriah. At first, therefore, there was no fault to be found in the official Tyrian attitude toward Jehovah&#x2019;s people Israel.

(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 6:8</a>.)

Nevertheless, certain relative perfections are set forth as attainable by sinful humans. Jesus told his followers: &#x201C;You must accordingly be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/64/0\" data-bid=\"65-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:48</a>) Here his reference was to the matter of love and generosity.

The one in whom God&#x2019;s love reaches full expression can approach his heavenly Father in confidence, not feeling condemned in his heart as if hypocritical or disapproved. He knows he is observing God&#x2019;s commandments and that he is doing what pleases his Father, and he is therefore free in his expressions and petitions to Jehovah. He does not feel as if under restriction by God as to what he is privileged to say or to ask for.

Perfection of the planet Earth is likewise not incompatible with variety, change, or contrast; it allows for the simple and the complex, the plain and the fancy, the sour and the sweet, the rough and the smooth, the meadows and the woods, the mountains and the valleys. It embraces the stimulating freshness of early spring, the warmth of summer with its azure-blue skies, the loveliness of autumn colors, the pure beauty of freshly fallen snow. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003440/113/0\" data-bid=\"114-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 8:22</a>) Perfect humans will thus not be stereotypes of identical personality, talents, and abilities. As the initial definitions have shown, this is not a necessary meaning of perfection."}
