When the shepherds arrived in the morning, they called to their flock, and the sheep responded to their shepherd and to him only. Walking ahead of the flock, the shepherd led it to pasture. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004016/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 10:1-5</a>) From personal observations in Syria and Palestine in the nineteenth century, W.&#xA0;M.&#xA0;Thomson wrote: &#x201C;[The sheep] are so tame and so trained that they <em>follow </em>their keeper with the utmost docility. He leads them forth from the fold, or from their houses in the villages, just where he pleases. As there are many flocks in such a place as this, each one takes a different path; and it is his business to find pasture for them. It is necessary, therefore, that they should be taught to follow, and not to stray away into the unfenced fields of corn which lie so temptingly on either side. Any one that thus wanders is sure to get into trouble. The shepherd calls sharply from time to time to remind them of his presence. They know his voice, and follow on; but if a stranger call, they stop short, lift up their heads in alarm, and, if it is repeated, they turn and flee, because they know not the voice of a stranger. This is not the fanciful costume of a <span id=\"page925\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"925\" data-before-text=\"925\"></span>parable; it is simple fact. I have made the experiment repeatedly. The shepherd goes before, not merely to point out the way but to see that it is practicable and safe.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Land and the Book, </em>revised by J.&#xA0;Grande, 1910, p.&#xA0;179.Similarly, J.&#xA0;L.&#xA0;Porter, in <em>The Giant Cities of Bashan and Syria&#x2019;s Holy Places, </em>observes: &#x201C;The shepherds led their flocks forth from the gates of the city. They were in full view, and we watched them and listened to them with no little interest. Thousands of sheep and goats were there, grouped in dense, confused masses. The shepherds stood together until all came out. Then they separated, each shepherd taking a different path, and uttering as he advanced a shrill peculiar call. The sheep heard them. At first the masses swayed and moved, as if shaken by some internal convulsion; then points struck out in the direction taken by the shepherds; these became longer and longer until the confused masses were resolved into long, living streams, flowing after their leaders.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;1868, p.&#xA0;45.In the evening the shepherd brought the animals back to the sheepfold, where he stationed himself at the door and counted the sheep as they passed beneath his crook or his hands.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004016/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Le 27:32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004016/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 33:13</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004016/1\">SHEEPFOLD</a>.<strong>A Rigorous Life. </strong>The shepherd&#x2019;s life was not an easy one.
