The fathom is commonly viewed as being four cubits (c.&#xA0;1.8&#xA0;m; 6&#xA0;ft) and approximately corresponds to the distance between the fingertips of a man&#x2019;s two hands when his arms are stretched in opposite directions. Appropriately, the Greek word for &#x201C;fathom&#x201D; (<em>or&#xB7;gui&#xB7;a&#x2B9;</em>) comes from a root meaning &#x201C;stretch out; reach.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001498/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 27:28</a>, ftn."}
