Hence, when God told Abraham that &#x201C;as regards Ishmael I have <em>heard </em>you,&#x201D; he was telling Abraham that he had given regard to his request, would act upon it.

From this term comes the negative form <em>a&#xB7;pei&#xB7;the&#x2B9;o </em>(meaning to disbelieve [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 14:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:9</a>] or disobey [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:36</a>]), as well as other related terms.From this it can be seen that obedience, as expressed in the original languages of the Scriptures, <span id=\"page521\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"521\" data-before-text=\"521\"></span>depends first upon hearing, that is, receiving information or knowledge (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 12:47, 48;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ti 1:13</a>), and then upon one&#x2019;s submitting to the will or desire of the one who speaks or otherwise expresses such will or desire. Submission, in turn, is dependent upon recognition of that one&#x2019;s authority or right to ask or require the response indicated, as also upon the hearer&#x2019;s desire or willingness to satisfy the will of such one. As indicated by the Greek <em>pei&#x2B9;tho </em>and <em>a&#xB7;pei&#xB7;the&#x2B9;o, </em>belief, trust, and confidence also enter in.<strong>Obedience to God Essential for Life. </strong>God has first claim to the obedience of all his creatures. They rightly owe him implicit obedience as their Maker, the Source from whom life derives and on whom life depends. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 95:6-8</a>) Because he is the All-wise and Almighty God, what he says merits the utmost respect and attention. A human father properly expects his word to be carried out by his children, and if a child is slow to respond, the parent may say emphatically, &#x201C;Did you <em>hear </em>me?&#x201D; Far more so does the heavenly Father rightly require receptive attention and response to his expressions.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">De 21:18-21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 4:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 64:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/20/3\" data-bid=\"21-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 1:14</a>.There is no substitute for obedience, no gaining of God&#x2019;s favor without it. As Samuel told King Saul: &#x201C;Does Jehovah have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying [form of <em>sha&#xB7;ma&#x2BD;&#x2B9;</em>] the voice of Jehovah? Look! To obey [literally, to listen] is better than a sacrifice, to pay attention than the fat of rams.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 15:22</a>) To fail to obey is to reject the word of Jehovah, to demonstrate that one really does not believe, trust, or have faith in that word and its Source. Hence the one failing to obey is no different from the one practicing divination or using idols. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 15:23</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 6:16</a>.) Verbal expressions of assent mean nothing if the required action does not follow; the lack of response proves a lack of belief or respect for the source of instructions.

Since true faith is &#x201C;the assured expectation of things hoped for&#x201D; and &#x201C;the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld,&#x201D; and since it requires believing that God is &#x201C;and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him,&#x201D; those having faith are moved to obey, having confidence and assurance as to the blessings that obedience will bring.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 11:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003292/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;6</a>.In harmony with this, God&#x2019;s communication to men is not simply a series of terse commands like those of an unfeeling dictator.
