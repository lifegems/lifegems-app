There were other documents used by the writers of both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures, such as official public genealogical records, histories, and so forth, but these were not regarded as inspired or on an equal level with the writings recognized as canonical. Even the apostles may have written other letters to certain congregations. For example, Paul&#x2019;s statement at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003860/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Corinthians 5:9</a>: &#x201C;In my letter I wrote you,&#x201D; implies that he wrote a previous letter to the Corinthians, one that is not now existent. Such writings evidently were not preserved by God&#x2019;s holy spirit for the Christian congregation because they were essential only to those to whom they were addressed.The Greek word <em>gram&#x2B9;ma, </em>denoting a letter, or character of the alphabet, is drawn from the verb <em>gra&#x2B9;pho. </em>Used in the sense of &#x201C;document,&#x201D; it is at times rendered &#x201C;scripture&#x201D; in some translations, &#x201C;writing&#x201D; in others.

Frequently these Hebrew writings as a whole were designated &#x201C;Scriptures.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003860/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 21:42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003860/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 22:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003860/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Mr 14:49;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003860/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> Joh 5:39;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003860/3/4\" data-bid=\"4-5\" class=\"b\"> Ac 17:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003860/3/5\" data-bid=\"4-6\" class=\"b\"> 18:24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003860/3/6\" data-bid=\"4-7\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;28</a>) Sometimes the singular form &#x201C;Scripture&#x201D; was used where a certain text was cited, referring to it as part of the entire body of writings in the Hebrew Scriptures.
