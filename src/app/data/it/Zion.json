Alluding to David&#x2019;s ruling from Zion as God&#x2019;s anointed one are Jehovah&#x2019;s words: &#x201C;I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004740/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 2:6</a>) Zion became a mountain especially holy to Jehovah when David had the sacred Ark transferred there.
