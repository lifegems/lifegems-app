(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 32:35,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 10:30</a>) The vengeance and the retribution are executed by God in complete self-control, in full harmony with his justice and never without abundant cause. For example, he punished Israel for disobedience, sometimes using pagan nations such as Assyria and Babylon as his instruments. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">De 28:15-68;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 17:7-23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 21:14-20</a>) But, on their part, these pagan nations acted out of hatred for Jehovah and his true worship, and they went too far in exulting over Israel&#x2019;s defeat and in oppressing Israel. Consequently God uttered judgments of retribution upon them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 10:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 34:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> Jer 51:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/2/4\" data-bid=\"3-5\" class=\"b\"> 56;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/2/5\" data-bid=\"3-6\" class=\"b\"> Ob 8-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/2/6\" data-bid=\"3-7\" class=\"b\"> Zec 1:15</a>.Babylon in particular suffered retribution for her age-old enmity against Jehovah and his people. Downfall and complete desolation were prophesied against her. She was overthrown by Cyrus the Persian in 539&#xA0;B.C.E. but continued to exist as a city for centuries, finally falling into utter desolation, never to be rebuilt.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 15:30</a>) In cases in which a man acted as a false witness, giving lying testimony against a fellowman before the judges, he was to receive retribution, the exact punishment that he would have caused the innocent man to receive. Jehovah said: &#x201C;And your eye should not feel sorry: soul will be for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">De 19:16-21</a>.<strong>On the Jewish Nation in the First Century. </strong>The Jewish nation manifested a selfish viewpoint in accepting God&#x2019;s undeserved kindnesses and favors to them. Jehovah allowed this selfish course and attitude to bring retribution upon them. They went about trying to establish their own righteousness instead of subjecting themselves to the righteousness of God. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003711/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 10:1-3</a>) As a result, the majority of the nation stumbled over Jesus Christ and rejected him, sharing bloodguilt in connection with his death, thereby bringing destruction to their city and temple and ruin to their nation.
