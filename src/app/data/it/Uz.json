Uz seemingly was near Edom, allowing for a later extension of Edomite domain into Uz, or for some later Edomites to be dwelling in the &#x201C;land of Uz,&#x201D; as is indicated at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004527/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Lamentations 4:21</a>. Jeremiah was commissioned to pass the cup of God&#x2019;s wrath to &#x201C;all the kings of the land of Uz,&#x201D; and the immediate context includes references to Philistia, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.
