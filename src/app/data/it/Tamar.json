Tamar married Judah&#x2019;s first son Er, but Jehovah put Er to death for his wickedness, leaving Tamar a widow. She was then given Onan, but Jehovah put him to death for failure to perform brother-in-law marriage, and Tamar still remained a childless widow. Judah procrastinated in giving her his third son. Tamar concealed her identity and disguised herself as a prostitute in order to get Judah himself to have relations with her, cleverly taking his seal ring, cord, and rod as security. When Judah learned that Tamar was pregnant, he at first commanded that she be burned after being stoned. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004313/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 7:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004313/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;25</a>.) But on learning that through her maneuvering to get an heir he had become the father, Judah exclaimed, &#x201C;She is more righteous than I am.&#x201D; In the difficult birth that followed, Tamar produced twins, Perez and Zerah.

Yohanan Aharoni identifies Tamar with <em>&#x2BD;</em>Ain Husb (&#x2BD;En Hazeva), about 30&#xA0;km (20&#xA0;mi) SSW of the Dead Sea.
