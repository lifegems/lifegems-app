While en route to Jerusalem in about 56&#xA0;C.E., the apostle Paul sailed to Mitylene from Assos, a seaport on the mainland of Asia Minor about 45&#xA0;km (28&#xA0;mi) to the NNW. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003091/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:14</a>) The fact that no mention is made of Paul&#x2019;s going ashore may imply that the ship merely anchored at Mitylene, perhaps because the needed N winds had abated. On the following day the ship continued SSW toward Chios.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003091/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:15</a>.It is believed that Mitylene originally occupied a small island off the eastern coast of Lesbos. But as the city grew it may have been linked with Lesbos by a causeway and expanded along the coast. This would have created a harbor on the N side and also one on the S side of the causeway. The city was famed as a seat of literary learning and for the architectural beauty of its buildings."}
