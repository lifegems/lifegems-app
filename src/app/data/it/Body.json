(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/51/1\" data-bid=\"52-2\" class=\"b\"> 31-33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/51/2\" data-bid=\"52-3\" class=\"b\"> Col 2:20-23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/51/3\" data-bid=\"52-4\" class=\"b\"> 3:5</a>) The apostle counsels: &#x201C;Bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 4:8</a>.One who is an anointed member of the Christian congregation, the body of Christ, and who commits fornication is taking a member of the Christ away and making that one a member of a harlot. Any such Christian committing fornication is bringing in moral defilement and is also &#x201C;sinning against his own [fleshly] body.&#x201D; He is putting himself in peril of being removed from the body of Christ, the temple organization, and is exposing himself to the danger of loathsome diseases. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 6:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/53/1\" data-bid=\"54-2\" class=\"b\"> 15-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/53/2\" data-bid=\"54-3\" class=\"b\"> Pr 7:1-27</a>) He may be &#x2018;handed over by the congregation to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.&#x2019;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 5:5</a>.One who is a member of the body of Christ, as well as other dedicated persons who are associated with these spiritually begotten body members, must avoid not only physical fornication but also spiritual fornication. The Scriptures call one who has friendship with the world an &#x2018;adulteress.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 4:4</a>) Jesus said of his disciples: &#x201C;They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.&#x201D; <span id=\"page350\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"350\" data-before-text=\"350\"></span>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 17:16</a>) Therefore, Jesus is careful that those who make up the members of his body are clean morally and spiritually. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 5:26,&#xA0;27</a>) They are said to have their &#x201C;bodies bathed with clean water.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:22</a>) As the apostle Paul says, speaking of husbands: &#x201C;In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it, as the Christ also does the congregation, because we are members of his body. &#x2018;For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.&#x2019; This sacred secret is great. Now I am speaking with respect to Christ and the congregation.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000783/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 5:28-32</a>.See parts of the body under individual names."}
