An ancient city in the mountainous region of Judah that was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 13:22</a>) Hebron is located about 30&#xA0;km (19&#xA0;mi) SSW of Jerusalem and lies over 900&#xA0;m (3,000&#xA0;ft) above sea level. It has the distinction of being one of the oldest still-inhabited locations in the Middle East. Hebron&#x2019;s ancient name &#x201C;Kiriath-arba&#x201D; (Town of Arba) appears to have been derived from its Anakim founder, Arba.

Blessed with <span id=\"page1083\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1083\" data-before-text=\"1083\"></span>numerous springs and wells, Hebron is surrounded by miles of greenery.The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob spent part of their alien residence at Hebron.

This cave, purchased along with surrounding land by Abraham from Hittite Ephron, became a family burial place, where Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob were also buried.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 23:2-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 49:29-33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 50:13</a>.At the time Moses sent the 12 spies into the Promised Land, the giantlike descendants of Anak were inhabiting Hebron.

The Israelites responded to Gibeon&#x2019;s appeal for aid and, with Jehovah&#x2019;s help, defeated the armies of the five kings that had come against Gibeon. Afterward these five kings, who had hidden themselves in a cave, were executed and their dead bodies hung upon stakes until evening.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 10:1-27</a>.As Israel&#x2019;s campaign in southern Canaan continued, the inhabitants of Hebron, including their king (evidently Hoham&#x2019;s successor), were devoted to destruction. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 10:36,&#xA0;37</a>) However, although the Israelites under Joshua broke the power of the Canaanites, it appears that they did not immediately establish garrisons to hold on to their conquests. Evidently while Israel was warring elsewhere, the Anakim reestablished themselves at Hebron, making it necessary for Caleb (or the sons of Judah under Caleb&#x2019;s leadership) to wrest the city from their control sometime afterward. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 11:21-23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 14:12-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 15:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/9/3\" data-bid=\"10-4\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:10</a>) Originally assigned to Caleb of the tribe of Judah, Hebron was afterward given a sacred status as a city of refuge. It also served as a priestly city. However, &#x201C;the field of the city [Hebron]&#x201D; and its settlements were Caleb&#x2019;s hereditary possession.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 14:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:9-13</a>.At Hebron, about four centuries later, the men of Judah anointed David as king. He ruled from there for seven and a half years, meanwhile becoming father to six sons, Amnon, Chileab (Daniel), Absalom, Adonijah, Shephatiah, and Ithream.

Upon returning from a raid and learning that David had sent Abner away in peace, Joab directed messengers to bring Abner back and then personally killed him at Hebron, where Abner was afterward buried.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 4:5-12</a>) Subsequently, David was anointed as king over all Israel, and he transferred his capital from Hebron to Jerusalem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 5:1-9</a>.Some years later David&#x2019;s son Absalom returned to Hebron and there initiated his unsuccessful usurpation of his father&#x2019;s kingship. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001956/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 15:7-10</a>) It was likely because of Hebron&#x2019;s historical importance as <span id=\"page1084\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1084\" data-before-text=\"1084\"></span>onetime capital of Judah, as well as because of its being his native city, that Absalom chose this city as the starting point of his drive for the throne. Later, David&#x2019;s grandson, King Rehoboam, rebuilt Hebron.
