The seaport town of Sidon was named after their forefather, and for many years it was the principal city of the Phoenicians, as the Greeks called the Sidonians. Today the city is known as Saida.A colony of Sidonians also settled about 35&#xA0;km (22&#xA0;mi) S of Sidon and called the place Tyre. In time Tyre surpassed Sidon in many respects, but she never completely lost her identity as a Sidonian settlement. The king of Tyre was sometimes called &#x201C;the king of the Sidonians&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004113/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 16:31</a>), and frequently Tyre and Sidon are mentioned together in prophecy.

At that time land under Sidon&#x2019;s control was yet remaining to be taken.
