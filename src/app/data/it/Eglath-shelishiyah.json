Some hold that there were three towns in one vicinity with the same name, and that the third (&#x201C;the third Eglath,&#x201D; <em>AT</em>) is here the target of the prophets&#x2019; utterances. A precise identification of such sites has never been made.<span id=\"page686\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"686\" data-before-text=\"686\"></span>Many scholars, however, are of the opinion that the Hebrew (<em>&#x2BD;egh&#xB7;lath&#x2B9; sheli&#xB7;shi&#xB7;yah&#x2B9;</em>) should not be transliterated as a proper noun. They view it as a symbolic expression and would translate it as &#x201C;a heifer of three years old.&#x201D; (<em>Dy, JP; </em>see <em>KJ, Ro.</em>) In this case, the prophets might be likening vanquished Moab to a sturdy, young, though full-grown, cow, but from which are heard only pitiful &#x2018;cries&#x2019; of anguish."}
