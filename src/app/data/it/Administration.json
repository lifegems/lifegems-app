It managed family affairs and property and enforced standards of conduct.The handling of Israel&#x2019;s national affairs by Moses according to the divine will during the 40-year wilderness trek provides a brilliant example of administration, including the delegation of authority to reliable subordinates.

Under King David the administrative structure was quite detailed, with officials directly under the king and with divisional administrators serving throughout the country. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000106/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 26:29-32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000106/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 27:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000106/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 16-22,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000106/9/3\" data-bid=\"10-4\" class=\"b\"> 25-34</a>) The priesthood was also thoroughly organized during David&#x2019;s reign, with supervisors for the tabernacle work, officers and judges, gatekeepers, singers and musicians, and the setting up of 24 priestly divisions for handling the service at the tabernacle.

This &#x201C;administration,&#x201D; or managerial procedure, which God has been carrying on since the day of Pentecost of 33&#xA0;C.E., has as its objective the unification of all his intelligent creatures.
