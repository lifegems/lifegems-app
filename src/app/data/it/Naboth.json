Naboth&#x2019;s vineyard in Jezreel was within sight of King Ahab&#x2019;s palace. Naboth declined Ahab&#x2019;s offer to buy the vineyard or to exchange it for a better vineyard somewhere else, because Jehovah had prohibited sale in perpetuity of a family inheritance.

Thereby Naboth and his sons were put to death (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003157/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 9:26</a>), enabling Ahab to take possession of the vineyard. Because of this murder, Elijah foretold that the dogs not only would eat up Jezebel but would also lick up Ahab&#x2019;s blood in the same place they licked up Naboth&#x2019;s blood. Ahab&#x2019;s offspring would similarly be cut off.
