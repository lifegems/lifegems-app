According to <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000438/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 7:14</a>, Asriel was a son of Manasseh born to him by his Syrian concubine. However, part of an apparent parenthetical statement that follows reads: &#x201C;She bore Machir the father of Gilead.&#x201D; Hence, as is not uncommon in Biblical genealogies, Asriel may here be termed a &#x201C;son&#x201D; of Manasseh only in the sense of being one of his later descendants (through Machir, Manasseh&#x2019;s son by his Syrian concubine). But it is possible that Manasseh had both a direct son and a great-grandson bearing the same name. &#x201C;The sons of Asriel&#x201D; were among the descendants of Manasseh to whom Joshua made territorial allotments in the Promised Land.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000438/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:1-4</a>."}
