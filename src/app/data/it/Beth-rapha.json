Keil and Delitzsch&#x2019;s <em>Commentary on the Old Testament </em>(1973, Vol.&#xA0;III, 1&#xA0;Chronicles, p.&#xA0;88) observes: &#x201C;Eshton begat the house (the family) of Rapha, of whom also nothing further is said; for they can be connected neither with the Benjamite Rapha (viii.&#xA0;2) nor with the children of Rapha (xx. 4, 6,&#xA0;8).&#x201D;"}
