In the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>&#x201C;Jeshurun&#x201D; becomes a term of affection, it being rendered &#x201C;beloved.&#x201D; The designation &#x201C;Jeshurun&#x201D; should have reminded Israel of its calling as Jehovah&#x2019;s covenant people and therefore of its obligation to remain upright.
