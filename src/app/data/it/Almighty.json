In this regard, <em>The Illustrated Bible Dictionary </em>(Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;572) comments: &#x201C;The former revelation, to the Patriarchs, concerned promises belonging to a distant future; it supposed that they should be assured that He, Yahweh, was such a God (<em>&#x2BC;el</em>) as was competent (one possible meaning of <em>sadday</em>) to fulfill them.
