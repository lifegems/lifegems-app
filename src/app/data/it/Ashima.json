(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000420/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000420/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;30</a>) Ashima, according to the Babylonian Talmud (<em>Sanhedrin </em>63<em>b</em>), was represented as a hairless he-goat, and for this reason some have identified Ashima with Pan, a pastoral god of fertility. Another suggestion is that the name Ashima may be a deliberate alteration of &#x201C;Asherah&#x201D; (the Canaanite fertility goddess) to combine it with the Hebrew word <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;sham&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;guilt&#x201D;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000420/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 26:10</a>). However, nothing can be stated with any certainty aside from what is contained in the Bible."}
