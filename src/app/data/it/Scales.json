The Law ruled as ceremonially clean for food &#x201C;everything that has fins and scales in the waters.&#x201D; Water animals lacking such could not be eaten; they were &#x201C;a loathsome thing.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Le 11:9, 10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> De 14:9,&#xA0;10</a>) Thus scales (Heb., <em>qas&#xB7;qas&#xB7;sim&#x2B9;, </em>plural of <em>qas&#xB7;qe&#x2B9;seth</em>) were one of the easily recognizable signs as to whether a certain fish could be eaten. Though there are four types of fish scales, most common are ctenoid scales (with a comblike edge) and cycloid scales (with a rounded border). These are arranged in overlapping rows, forming a thin, light, and flexible covering.The same Hebrew word is used in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 29:4</a>, where the Egyptian Pharaoh is symbolically described as what seems to be a crocodile. The entire body of a crocodile is covered with strong plates of horn set in its leathery skin. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Job 41:15-17</a> apparently also refers to the scales (<em>AS, NW, MR</em>) of the crocodile, in this case using the Hebrew word that is often translated &#x201C;shield.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/0\">LEVIATHAN</a>.<strong>Scales for Weighing. </strong>A device for weighing objects. The ancients were acquainted with the simple beam scale, or balance. It consisted of a horizontal bar, or beam, pivoted at the center on a peg or cord, and from each end of the beam hung a pan or hook. The object to be weighed was put in one pan (or hung on one hook, as with a small bag of money), and the known weights were put on the other side. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 32:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 46:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Ge 23:15, 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> Eze 5:1</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003850/1\">MONEY</a>.) During a famine, even food might be measured carefully on a balance.
