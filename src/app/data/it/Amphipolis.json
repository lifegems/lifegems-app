Paul passed through here on his second missionary tour. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000249/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 17:1</a>) It was built on a hill surrounded on three sides (N, W, and S) by the curving river Strymon, which situation doubtless gave name to the city. Amphipolis lay about 50&#xA0;km (30&#xA0;mi) WSW of Philippi and, due to its position on the famous Roman highway <em>Via Egnatia </em>and its control of the bridge over the river Strymon, was of considerable importance strategically and commercially. Originally founded as an Athenian colony in the fifth century B.C.E., it later came under the Macedonians. Thereafter Rome took control and made it a free city and the capital of the first district of Macedonia. The archaeological site is located just outside the modern village also named Amphipolis (Amfipoli)."}
