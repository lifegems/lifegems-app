(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 4:7-24</a>) Between the reigns of Cyrus the Great, who allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem (537&#xA0;B.C.E.), and of Darius the Great, who in 520&#xA0;B.C.E. removed the ban imposed on the temple construction, possibly three kings ruled: Cambyses&#xA0;II, his brother Bardiya (or possibly a Magian known as Gaumata who is said to have pretended to be Bardiya and ruled for seven months), and Nidintu-Bel (who was defeated and killed by Darius after just two months). Cambyses is evidently represented by the &#x201C;Ahasuerus&#x201D; mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ezra 4:6</a> to whom the first protest was made by the opposers of the temple reconstruction. Therefore, beginning with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ezra 4:7</a>, the ruler referred to as &#x201C;Artaxerxes&#x201D; is either Bardiya or Gaumata, whose rule lasted but seven months (522&#xA0;B.C.E.).The people of the cities of Samaria wrote a letter against the Jews to this Persian king. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 4:7</a>) <span id=\"page182\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"182\" data-before-text=\"182\"></span>This was while the Jews were busy building the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 4:1-3</a>) In order to achieve their goal, the adversaries of the Jews resorted to lies, stating that the Jews were then rebuilding the city of Jerusalem, including its walls. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 4:11-16</a>) As a result of these false accusations, &#x201C;the work on the house of God&#x201D; came to a halt.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 4:24</a>.<strong>2. </strong>Artaxerxes Longimanus, the son of Xerxes&#xA0;I, is the king referred to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ezra 7:1-28</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Nehemiah 2:1-18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 13:6</a>. Whereas most reference works give his accession year as 465&#xA0;B.C.E., there is sound reason for placing it in 475&#xA0;B.C.E.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/0\">PERSIA, PERSIANS</a> (The Reigns of Xerxes and of Artaxerxes).Artaxerxes Longimanus extended permission to Ezra the priest and also to Nehemiah to make trips to Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 7:1-7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Ne 2:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 7,&#xA0;8</a>) Ancient historians credit him with a generally benign and generous personality. This coincides with his actions during the seventh year of his reign (468&#xA0;B.C.E.), when Longimanus granted Ezra &#x201C;all his request&#x201D; in a decree that provided for silver, gold, and vessels for temple use, as well as provisions of wheat, wine, oil, and salt. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 7:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 12-23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 8:25-27</a>) This generous contribution may explain why Artaxerxes is included along with Cyrus and Darius at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ezra 6:14</a> as one of those whose orders contributed to the &#x2018;building and finishing&#x2019; of the temple, although the actual construction had been completed 47 years previously, in 515&#xA0;B.C.E. The king&#x2019;s decree even authorized Ezra to appoint magistrates and judges to teach God&#x2019;s law (as well as that of the king) and to use capital punishment against violators where necessary.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 7:25,&#xA0;26</a>.During the 20th year of his reign (455&#xA0;B.C.E.), Artaxerxes Longimanus granted permission to Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls and gates of the city. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:1-8</a>) Because this is referred to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Daniel 9:25</a> as relating to the time of the promised coming of the Messiah, the date of Artaxerxes&#x2019; 20th year is very important.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000389/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Nehemiah 13:6</a> refers to &#x201C;the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes,&#x201D; that is, 443&#xA0;B.C.E., when Nehemiah returned for a time to the court of this king."}
