It is the smallest of the Hebrew letters. The name of the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet, <em>i&#xB7;o&#x2B9;ta, </em>evidently is akin to the Hebrew <em>yohdh. </em>Since the Law of Moses was originally written and subsequently preserved in Hebrew, it is likely that Jesus was referring back to the Hebrew <em>yohdh </em>when he said that the &#x201C;smallest letter [Gr., <em>i&#xB7;o&#x2B9;ta</em>]&#x201D; would not pass away without its due fulfillment. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004638/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:18</a>) This letter occurs as the initial letter in the Tetragrammaton, or sacred name Jehovah (reading from right to left: &#x5D9;&#x5D4;&#x5D5;&#x5D4;), and as such was carried over into the earliest copies of the Greek <em>Septuagint. </em>A vellum leaf of the third century C.E. (P.&#xA0;Oxyrhynchus vii. 1007) containing a portion of the <em>Septuagint </em>translation of Genesis represented the divine name Jehovah by a doubled <em>yohdh.<wbr></em>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004638/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:8</a>, ftn.Because of the similarity between the letters <em>yohdh </em>(&#x5D9;)&#xA0;and <em>waw </em>(&#x5D5;), they were sometimes confused by copyists. In the Hebrew, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004638/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 119:73-80</a> each verse begins with the letter <em>yohdh.</em>"}
