It was named after its capital, Abila, a city situated in a picturesque gorge by the bank of the river Abanah (modern Barada).At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000043/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 3:1</a> we are told that in the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar (28/29&#xA0;C.E.) the district was ruled by Lysanias. This fact is confirmed by an inscription found at Abila in connection with a temple dedication dating from the reign of Tiberius. This inscription bears the name &#x201C;Lysanias the tetrarch.&#x201D; Previously, Abilene had formed part of the kingdom of Herod the Great, but following his death, about the year 1&#xA0;B.C.E., it was included in the province of Syria. Josephus records that the tetrarchy of Lysanias was joined to Palestine, in 37&#xA0;C.E., under Herod Agrippa&#xA0;I, and that it was thereafter bestowed upon Herod Agrippa&#xA0;II by Claudius, in 53&#xA0;C.E."}
