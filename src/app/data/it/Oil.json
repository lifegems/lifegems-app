Fully ripened black olives gave the most oil, but those yet green, though beginning to change in color, produced the oil of finest quality. After the fruit was carefully removed from the trees, and the twigs and leaves were cleaned from the olives, they were carried to the oil press.The pulp of the ripe olive berry is about half oil, which varies in grade according to the method of processing the pulp. The very best, called &#x201C;pure, beaten olive oil,&#x201D; was produced by a simple process before the olives were put into the press. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003313/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Le 24:2</a>) First, the olives were placed in a mortar and beaten until they were well bruised, or they were sometimes trodden by foot. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003313/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 6:15</a>) Next, the bruised fruit was transferred to strainer baskets in which it &#x201C;bled&#x201D; oil until the &#x201C;virgin&#x201D; oil was released. The pure, beaten oil was stored in earthenware jars, and the pulp was moved to the olive press.A common grade of oil was prepared by thoroughly crushing the olives in a mortar or hand mill. After the oil ran off from the pulp, it was allowed to clarify in clay jars or vats.The lowest grade of oil was that pressed from the pulp refuse in an olive press after the crushing process. The pulverized mass of pulp was packed into baskets and stacked between the two vertical pillars of the olive press. A weighted lever was applied to the stack of baskets to press out the oil, which was then channeled into large reservoirs for clearing. There, the oil would rise to the surface, separating from the bits of pulp and the water below before it was drawn off into large earthenware jars or special cisterns for storage.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003313/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 32:27, 28</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003313/0\">PRESS</a>.<strong>A Symbol of Prosperity. </strong>Great prosperity was signified when reference was made to the &#x2018;press vats overflowing with oil.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003313/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joe 2:24</a>) Suffering Job longed for his previous days of plenty when &#x201C;the rock kept pouring out streams of oil&#x201D; for him.
