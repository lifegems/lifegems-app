The one accused is called to account.One Hebrew word rendered &#x201C;accusation&#x201D; (<em>sit&#xB7;nah&#x2B9;</em>) comes from the root verb <em>sa&#xB7;tan&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;resist.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000071/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 4:6</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000071/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 3:1</a>.) The most common Greek word for &#x201C;accuse&#x201D; is <em>ka&#xB7;te&#xB7;go&#xB7;re&#x2B9;o, </em>carrying the idea of &#x2018;speaking against&#x2019; someone, usually in a judicial or legal sense. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000071/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 3:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000071/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 6:7</a>) At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000071/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 16:1</a> the Greek word <em>di&#xB7;a&#xB7;bal&#x2B9;lo, </em>rendered &#x2018;accuse,&#x2019; may also be translated &#x2018;slander.&#x2019; (<em>Int</em>) It is related to <em>di&#xB7;a&#x2B9;bo&#xB7;los </em>(slanderer), root of the word &#x201C;Devil.&#x201D;The Greek term translated &#x2018;accuse falsely&#x2019; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000071/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 3:14</a> (<em>sy&#xB7;ko&#xB7;phan&#xB7;te&#x2B9;o</em>) is rendered &#x2018;extort by false accusation&#x2019; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000071/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 19:8</a>. It literally means &#x201C;take by fig-showing.&#x201D; Of the various explanations of the origin of this word, one is that in ancient Athens the exporting of figs from the province was prohibited. One who denounced others, accusing them of attempting to export figs, was termed a &#x201C;fig-shower.&#x201D; The term came to designate a malignant informer, a person who accused others out of a love of gain, a false accuser, a blackmailer.One might be called to account and charged with wrong, yet be entirely innocent, blameless, the victim of a false accuser. Hebrew law, therefore, set forth the responsibility each one in the nation had to bring to account wrongdoers, and at the same time it adequately provided protection for the accused. A few examples from the Mosaic Law will serve to illustrate these principles. If a person had any knowledge respecting a crime, he had to bring the accusation before the proper authorities.
