The mule&#x2019;s body resembles that of the horse, but its short, thick head, long ears, short mane, small feet, and tail terminated by a tuft of long hairs are characteristic of the ass. The mule (<em>Equus asinus mulus</em>) combines some of the finer qualities of both parents: the endurance, hardiness, and surefootedness of the ass, and the strength, vigor, and courage of the horse. The animal is less prone to disease than the horse, displays greater patience when bearing heavy burdens, and enjoys a much longer life span. The hinny, the offspring of a stallion and a she-ass, is smaller than the mule and lacks its strength and beauty. Both sexes of the mule, with rare exceptions, are sterile.These animals were among the gifts brought to Solomon by kings desiring to hear his wisdom.
