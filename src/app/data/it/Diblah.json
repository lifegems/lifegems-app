Any ancient location by this name is unknown, and most modern scholars, therefore, hold that &#x201C;Diblah&#x201D; is a copyist&#x2019;s error for &#x201C;Riblah,&#x201D; the initial Hebrew letter for &#x201C;R&#x201D; (&#x5E8;)&#xA0;being easily mistaken for the Hebrew letter for &#x201C;D&#x201D; (&#x5D3;). If this is the case, it may be identified with the Biblical Riblah (ruins near modern Ribleh) at the Orontes River, &#x201C;in the land of Hamath&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001170/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 23:33</a>), and &#x201C;the wilderness toward Diblah [Riblah]&#x201D; could have reference to the gravelly unbroken plain of the Syrian Desert that lies to the S and SE of Riblah. Some translators, however, render Ezekiel&#x2019;s words to read &#x201C;from the wilderness to Riblah.&#x201D; (<em>RS</em>) According to such rendering, the meaning might be that Jehovah&#x2019;s judgment would extend from &#x201C;the wilderness,&#x201D; the Promised Land&#x2019;s traditional southern boundary (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001170/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 23:31</a>), to the region of &#x201C;Hamath&#x201D; (represented by Riblah) far to the north. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001170/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 8:65</a>) Ezekiel&#x2019;s use of such a phrase would then be the equivalent of the better known &#x201C;from Dan down to Beer-sheba.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001170/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 20:1</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001170/0\">RIBLAH</a> No.&#xA0;2."}
