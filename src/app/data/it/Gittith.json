The term seems to be derived from the Hebrew word <em>gath, </em>which is also the name of a town located on the border of Judah and Philistia. Some have suggested that &#x201C;Gittith&#x201D; denotes a tune associated with vintage songs, since <em>gath </em>refers to a winepress. The Greek <em>Septuagint </em>and the Latin <em>Vulgate, </em>therefore, render &#x201C;Gittith&#x201D; as &#x201C;winepresses.&#x201D;"}
