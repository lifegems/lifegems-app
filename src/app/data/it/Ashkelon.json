(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:3</a>) It is identified with <em>&#x2BD;</em>Asqalan (Tel Ashqelon) located about 19&#xA0;km (12&#xA0;mi) NNE of Gaza. The city was situated in a naturally formed rocky amphitheater, the concave part facing toward the Mediterranean. The countryside is fertile, producing apples, figs, and the small onion known as the scallion, which apparently derives its name from that of the Philistine city.Ashkelon was assigned to the tribe of Judah and was captured by them, but it apparently did not remain subject to them for long. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:18,&#xA0;19</a>) It was a Philistine city in the time of Samson and of Samuel.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 1:20</a>) In King Uzziah&#x2019;s conquest of Philistine cities, Ashkelon is not listed as among those taken.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 26:6</a>.In the prophecy of Amos (c.&#xA0;804&#xA0;B.C.E.) prediction was made of defeat for the ruler of Ashkelon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Am 1:8</a>) Secular history shows that in the succeeding century Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III of Assyria made <em>Asqaluna </em>(Ashkelon) a vassal city. Jeremiah (after 647&#xA0;B.C.E.) uttered two prophecies involving Ashkelon. While <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 47:2-7</a> could have seen some fulfillment when Nebuchadnezzar sacked the city early in his reign (c.&#xA0;624&#xA0;B.C.E.), the prophecy at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 25:17-20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 28, 29</a> clearly indicates a fulfillment subsequent to the fall of Jerusalem in 607&#xA0;B.C.E. Zephaniah&#x2019;s prophecy (written before 648&#xA0;B.C.E.) also foretold a coming desolation for Ashkelon, along with other Philistine cities, after which the remnant of Judah would eventually occupy &#x201C;the houses of Ashkelon.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Zep 2:4-7</a>) Finally, about 518&#xA0;B.C.E., Zechariah proclaimed doom for Ashkelon in connection with the time of Tyre&#x2019;s desolation (332&#xA0;B.C.E.).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000421/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 9:3-5</a>."}
