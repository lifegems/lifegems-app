(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004176/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:2,&#xA0;3</a>) Many scholars believe that the original sites of Sodom and the other &#x201C;cities of the District&#x201D; now lie submerged beneath the waters of the Dead Sea, though some others recently have claimed that the ruins of the cities may be identified with sites along wadis to the E and SE of the Dead Sea.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004176/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 13:12</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004176/0\">SALT SEA</a>.When Abraham and Lot decided to move farther apart, to avoid disputes among their herdsmen, Lot went eastward into the well-watered District of the Jordan and pitched his tent near Sodom. There he found that &#x201C;the men of Sodom were bad and were gross sinners against Jehovah,&#x201D; much to Lot&#x2019;s distress.

In the <span id=\"page985\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"985\" data-before-text=\"985\"></span>following year, Chedorlaomer and his allies defeated Bera, the king of Sodom, and his confederates. Besides seizing possessions and foodstuffs, the victors took Lot and others captive.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004176/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:1-12</a>.Abraham&#x2019;s forces overtook Chedorlaomer and recovered the captives and booty, including Lot and his household. The king of Sodom insisted that Abraham keep the recovered material goods, but Abraham refused, lest Bera should say, &#x201C;It was I who made Abram rich.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004176/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:13-24</a>.<strong>Everlasting Destruction. </strong>Sodom, however, persisted in a course in defiance of Jehovah, becoming known for such immoral practices as homosexuality. &#x201C;The cry of complaint about Sodom and Gomorrah,&#x201D; Jehovah declared, &#x201C;yes, it is loud, and their sin, yes, it is very heavy.&#x201D; God therefore sent his angels to destroy Sodom, with the assurance to Abraham that if ten righteous persons could be found in the place, the whole city would be spared.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004176/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 18:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004176/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 20-33</a>.The city showed it deserved destruction, for a vile mob of residents of Sodom, including boys and old men, surrounded Lot&#x2019;s house, attempting to rape his angelic guests. The next day, after Lot, along with his wife and two daughters, left the city, Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by sulfur and fire.
