It was one of the valuable products awaiting the Israelites in the Promised Land, and that region continues to be &#x201C;a land of wheat and barley&#x201D; to this day.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 8:8</a>.The Hebrew name for barley (<em>se&#x2BD;o&#xB7;rah&#x2B9;</em>) is related to the word for &#x201C;hair&#x201D; (<em>se&#xB7;&#x2BD;ar&#x2B9;</em>) and is descriptive of the long slender bristles or awns forming the characteristic beard of the barley head. It is a very hardy plant, better able to withstand drought and adapt to a wider range of climates than any other grain. When mature it stands about 1&#xA0;m (3&#xA0;ft) high, with somewhat broader leaves than those of wheat.The barley harvest figures prominently in the dramatic events of the book of Ruth. Sowing of barley was done in Israel during the month of Bul (October-November) after the early rains had begun to fall and the ground could be plowed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 28:24,&#xA0;25</a>) Barley matures more rapidly than wheat (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 9:31,&#xA0;32</a>), and the harvest began in the early spring during the month of Nisan (March-April), commencing in the hot Jordan Valley and continuing into the higher, more temperate sections until it reached the highland plateau region E of the Jordan in the month of Ziv (April-May). Barley harvest thus marked a definite time of the year (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ru 1:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 21:9</a>), and its start corresponded to Passover time, the sheaf waved by the priest on the 16th day of Nisan being of the barley firstfruits.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Le 23:10,&#xA0;11</a>.Barley was esteemed as of less value than wheat, just one third that of wheat in John&#x2019;s vision at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 6:6</a>.

It was ground into flour and made into bread, often in the form of a round cake (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 4:42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Eze 4:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 6:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>), and sometimes mixed with other grains.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000565/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 4:9</a>.Though undoubtedly more frequently used among the poor because of its lower cost, there is nothing to indicate that barley was viewed with disdain among the Israelites, even by those able to afford wheat. Thus, it was included in the provisions suitable for offering to King David&#x2019;s company upon their arrival in Gilead during the time of Absalom&#x2019;s revolt.
