That is why individuals of that nation who practiced uncleanness or wrongdoing brought defilement and Jehovah&#x2019;s disfavor upon the nation, unless action was taken to clear them out. Greedy, disobedient Achan is a case in point; his sin brought distress on Israel until he was discovered and stoned to death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002059/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Jos&#xA0;7</a>.Aaron, anointed with the holy anointing oil as the nation&#x2019;s high priest, was holy in a special, intensified sense.

A sin on the part of the high priest (for example, an error in judgment of a matter) could bring guiltiness upon the people and had to be atoned for by the sacrifice of a young bull, the same sacrifice required for a mistake of the entire assembly.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002059/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Le 4:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002059/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 13,&#xA0;14</a>.<strong>Christian Holy Ones. </strong>Persons brought into relationship with God by means of the new covenant are sanctified, cleansed, and set apart for God&#x2019;s exclusive service by &#x201C;the blood of the covenant,&#x201D; the shed blood of Jesus Christ.

Consequently, they do not become &#x201C;holy ones,&#x201D; or &#x201C;saints,&#x201D; by decree of a man or an organization, but by God, who brings them into covenant relationship with himself through the blood of Jesus Christ. The term &#x201C;holy ones&#x201D; applies to all those thus brought into union and joint heirship with Christ, not to a mere few considered to have exceptional holiness. It is also applied in the Bible to them from the beginning of their sanctified course on earth, not being deferred until after their death. Peter says they must be holy because God is holy.
