(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000984/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 17:5-8</a>) Regarding the use of the Greek term, G.&#xA0;Ernest Wright says: &#x201C;An inscription on this gate [the Vardar Gate from Thessalonica], now in the British Museum, mentions some city officials called &#x2018;politarchs&#x2019;. A number of other inscriptions contain the same word. In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000984/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 17:6</a> this term is also used as the name of the officials before whom Christians were dragged during the riot caused by Paul&#x2019;s preaching. The word is otherwise unknown in extant Greek literature and the archaeological information is a confirmation of the accuracy of Luke&#x2019;s narrative at this point.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Biblical Archaeology, </em>1962, p.&#xA0;260; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000984/0\">ARCHAEOLOGY</a> (Relating to the Christian Greek Scriptures)."}
