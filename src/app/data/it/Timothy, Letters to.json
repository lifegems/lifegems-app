(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ti 1:1</a>) The first letter was evidently written from Macedonia. A basis for assigning an approximate date for the composition of this letter is found in the first chapter, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">verse 3</a>, which reads: &#x201C;Just as I encouraged you to stay in Ephesus when I was about to go my way into Macedonia, so I do now.&#x201D; There is no mention of this in the book of Acts, which covers a period from the time of Jesus&#x2019; ascension to heaven in 33&#xA0;C.E. until the second year of Paul&#x2019;s imprisonment in Rome, about 61&#xA0;C.E. Accordingly, it seems that it was sometime after his being released that Paul encouraged Timothy to stay in Ephesus, and then Paul apparently departed for Macedonia. This would place the time for the writing of First Timothy between the date of the apostle&#x2019;s release from his first imprisonment at Rome and his final imprisonment there, or about 61-64&#xA0;C.E. The second letter was composed at Rome during Paul&#x2019;s final imprisonment (likely c. 65&#xA0;C.E.) and not long before his death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 1:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 4:6-9</a>.<strong>Authenticity. </strong>The authenticity of First and Second Timothy is well established.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:29,&#xA0;30</a>) Within a few years the situation regarding the teaching of false doctrines did become so serious that Paul encouraged Timothy to stay in Ephesus, that he &#x201C;might command certain ones not to teach different doctrine, nor to pay attention to false stories and to genealogies.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 1:3,&#xA0;4</a>) Timothy, therefore, had to wage spiritual warfare inside the Christian congregation to preserve its purity and to help its members to remain in the faith. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">1:18,&#xA0;19</a>) His applying the things mentioned in the apostle&#x2019;s letter would serve to protect members of the congregation from falling away.For the congregation to prosper, prayer could not be overlooked. So that Christians might go on leading a calm and quiet life, without interference, it was proper for them to pray concerning kings and men in high governmental station. Regarding those representing the congregation in prayer, Paul wrote: &#x201C;I desire that in every place the men carry on prayer, lifting up loyal hands, apart from wrath and debates.&#x201D; This meant approaching God in a pure way, without any feelings of animosity or anger toward others.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 2:1-8</a>.Timothy also had to be alert that women kept their God-assigned place (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 2:9-15</a>), that only qualified men served as overseers and ministerial servants because such would serve as a strong bulwark against apostasy (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">3:1-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> 5:22</a>), that deserving widows received assistance from the congregation (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">5:3-16</a>), that due consideration was given to the older men presiding in a fine manner (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">5:17-19</a>), that slaves conducted themselves aright toward their owners (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">6:1,&#xA0;2</a>), that all were content with what they had instead of seeking to be rich (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">6:6-10</a>), and that the rich did not rest their hopes on material things, being instead rich <span id=\"page1107\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1107\" data-before-text=\"1107\"></span>in fine works and manifesting generosity (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">6:17-19</a>).

Rumor had it that Caesar Nero was responsible for it. To protect himself, Nero placed the blame upon the Christians. This appears to have prompted a wave of violent governmental persecution. It was likely about this time (c.&#xA0;65&#xA0;C.E.) that the apostle Paul was again imprisoned at Rome. Though forsaken by many, suffering in chains, and facing imminent death (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 1:15, 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> 4:6-8</a>), the apostle wrote an encouraging letter to Timothy, one that prepared his younger fellow worker to resist apostate elements inside the congregation and to stand firm in the face of persecution. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">2:3-7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> 14-26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/25/2\" data-bid=\"26-3\" class=\"b\"> 3:14&#x2013;4:5</a>) By learning about Paul&#x2019;s circumstances, Timothy would have been able to draw encouragement from the apostle&#x2019;s good example of faithful endurance under great tribulation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004417/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">2:8-13</a>.Fearless in the strength of Jehovah, Paul exhorted Timothy: &#x201C;Stir up like a fire the gift of God which is in you through the laying of my hands upon you.
