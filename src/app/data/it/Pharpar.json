This river is usually linked with the Nahr el-&#x2BC;A&#x2BD;waj. Besides the Nahr Barada (identified with the Abanah), it is the only independent stream in the Damascus area. But the volume of the &#x2BC;A&#x2BD;waj is about one quarter that of the Barada. The smaller streams that unite to form the &#x2BC;A&#x2BD;waj take their rise on the eastern slopes of Mount Hermon and merge about 30&#xA0;km (19&#xA0;mi) SW of Damascus. From this point the river winds its way through a deep rocky channel until finally losing itself in a swamp to the SE of Damascus. The airline distance spanned by this river (including its sources) is about 64&#xA0;km (40&#xA0;mi).The major objection raised to the above identification is that the &#x2BC;A&#x2BD;waj is not actually a &#x2018;river of Damascus,&#x2019; since it flows about 15&#xA0;km (9.5&#xA0;mi) and more to the S of that city. For this reason some favor identifying the Pharpar with the Nahr Taura, a branch of the Nahr Barada. However, Naaman&#x2019;s reference to Damascus could have included the Plain of Damascus through which the Nahr el-&#x2BC;A&#x2BD;waj courses."}
