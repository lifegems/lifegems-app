The Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>the Syriac <em>Peshitta, </em>and the Latin <em>Vulgate </em>here render &#x201C;Eber&#x201D; as &#x201C;the Hebrews.&#x201D; However, &#x201C;Eber&#x201D; may in this case be referring to the land or people on the &#x2018;other side&#x2019; of the Euphrates (in addition to Assyria, mentioned in the same verse). In Hebrew the expression for &#x201C;beyond the River&#x201D; (Heb., <em>&#x2BD;e&#x2B9;ver han&#xB7;na&#xB7;har&#x2B9;</em>) is used at times to refer to the region W of the Euphrates.

In the days of his son Peleg, whom Eber outlived by about 191 years, &#x201C;the earth was divided.&#x201D; This may have reference to Jehovah&#x2019;s confusing the language of those who were building Babel and its tower under the direction of Nimrod.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:14-19,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;26</a>.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 10:21</a> refers to &#x201C;Shem, the forefather of all the sons of Eber [&#x201C;ancestor of all the Hebrews,&#x201D; <em>AT, Mo</em>], the brother of Japheth the oldest.&#x201D; Evidently Eber is here listed in close relation to Shem because of the Biblical importance attached to Eber&#x2019;s descendants, particularly from Abraham forward. The text, therefore, does not restrict Shem&#x2019;s descendants to just the Hebrews, as the succeeding verses make clear. Eber&#x2019;s descendants through Joktan appear to have settled in Arabia, while those through Peleg are associated with Mesopotamia.<strong>2. </strong>A Gadite living in Bashan, a descendant of Abihail.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 5:11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 13,&#xA0;14</a>.<strong>3. </strong>A Benjamite identified as a son of Elpaal.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 8:12</a>.<strong>4. </strong>A Benjamite headman listed among the sons of Shashak.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 8:22-25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001249/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;28</a>.<strong>5. </strong>A Levite priest; the head of the paternal house of Amok.
