King Chedorlaomer and his allies defeated the Amorites dwelling in Hazazon-tamar. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001932/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:5-8</a>) Centuries later the combined forces of Moab, Ammon, and the mountainous region of Seir came against Judah by way of &#x201C;Hazazon-tamar, that is to say, En-gedi.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001932/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 20:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001932/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 10,&#xA0;11</a>) Many scholars believe that the Genesis reference points to a location some distance S of En-gedi and therefore regard the words &#x201C;that is to say, En-gedi,&#x201D; as a late addition. The name &#x201C;Hazazon-tamar,&#x201D; however, appears to be preserved in the Wadi Hasasa (Nahal Hazezon) about 10&#xA0;km (6&#xA0;mi) N of the suggested site of En-gedi. Also, the meaning of Hazazon-tamar would fit the En-gedi region, described by Josephus as a place where &#x201C;the finest palm-trees&#x201D; are grown. (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>IX, 7 [i,&#xA0;2]) So if the Genesis passage refers to a more southerly location, possibly there were two places called Hazazon-tamar: the one linked with En-gedi; the other perhaps the site SW of the Dead Sea that is called simply Tamar.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001932/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 47:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001932/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 48:28</a>."}
