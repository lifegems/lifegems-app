The exact location of the ancient site is uncertain. However, the name Eglaim and a similar name, Agallim, mentioned by Eusebius (<em>Onomasticon, </em>36, 19-21) as about 12&#xA0;km (7.5&#xA0;mi) S of Rabbath-Moab, may be preserved at Rujm el-Jilimeh in that area or at Khirbet Jeljul, a location dating from Nabataean-Roman times, 7&#xA0;km (4&#xA0;mi) farther south. Yohanan Aharoni suggests identifying it with Mazra&#x2BD;, an oasis NE of the Lisan Peninsula."}
