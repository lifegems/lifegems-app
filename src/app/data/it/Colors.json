Matthew described the cloak as it appeared to him, that is, according to his evaluation of color, and he emphasized the garment&#x2019;s red hue. John and Mark subdued the red tint, calling it purple. &#x201C;Purple&#x201D; can be applied to any color having components of both blue and red. So, Mark and John agree with Matthew that the garment was red to some extent. Of course, background and light reflection could have given it different casts. A body of water varies in color at different times, depending upon the particular color of the sky and the reflection of light at a given time. So, when such factors are considered, it is seen that the Gospel writers were not in conflict in describing the color of the cloak that mocking Roman soldiers clothed Christ with on the last day of his human life."}
