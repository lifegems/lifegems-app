(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 45:13</a>) The Greek equivalent of <em>ka&#xB7;vohdh&#x2B9; </em>is <em>do&#x2B9;xa, </em>which originally meant &#x201C;opinion; reputation,&#x201D; but in the Christian Greek Scriptures came to mean &#x201C;glory.&#x201D; Among its senses are repute or &#x201C;honor&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 14:10</a>), splendor (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 15:40</a>), and that which brings honor to its owner or maker (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 11:7</a>).Often the Scriptures mention glory in connection with Jehovah God. As to its meaning in these cases the <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, </em>edited by G.&#xA0;Kittel, explains: &#x201C;If in relation to man [<em>ka&#xB7;vohdh&#x2B9;</em>] denotes that which makes him impressive and demands recognition, whether in terms of material possessions or striking [dignity or importance], in relation to God it implies that which makes God impressive to man.&#x201D; (Translated by G.&#xA0;Bromiley, 1971, Vol.&#xA0;II, p.&#xA0;238) So glory may refer to an impressive evidence of God&#x2019;s almighty power. Thus, the visible heavenly bodies are &#x201C;declaring the glory of God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 19:1</a>) On Mount Sinai, &#x201C;Jehovah&#x2019;s glory&#x201D; was evidenced by such fearsome manifestations as &#x201C;a devouring fire.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 24:16-18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> compare 16:7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/8/3\" data-bid=\"9-4\" class=\"b\"> 40:34</a>.Concerning Jesus&#x2019; first miracle, the Bible says that &#x201C;he made his glory manifest.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001721/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 2:11</a>) <span id=\"page964\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"964\" data-before-text=\"964\"></span>Glory here refers to an impressive evidence of miraculous power identifying Jesus as the promised Messiah.

In answer to that prayer, Jehovah &#x201C;glorified his Servant, Jesus,&#x201D; by resurrecting him and bringing him back into heaven.
