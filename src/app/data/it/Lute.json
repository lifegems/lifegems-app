Hence, the plural form <em>sha&#xB7;li&#xB7;shim&#x2B9; </em>at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002793/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 18:6</a> has been variously translated as &#x201C;instruments of three strings&#x201D; (<em>Ro</em>), &#x201C;three-stringed instruments&#x201D; (<em>Yg</em>), and as favored by some modern lexicons, &#x201C;lutes&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>). The context of this verse suggests a comparatively light musical instrument, for it was played by Israelite women as they sang and danced in celebration of the victories of King Saul and of David.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002793/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:6,&#xA0;7</a>."}
