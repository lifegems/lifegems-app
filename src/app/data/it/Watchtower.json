(See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004581/0\">TOWER</a>.) Other watchtowers were constructed in wilderness areas or on frontiers. They were principally designed for military purposes and served to protect a city or a boundary; they were also constructed as places of refuge for shepherds and farmers in isolated areas and enabled a watchman to warn of marauders so that flocks and ripening crops in the area might be protected.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004581/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 20:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004581/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 21:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004581/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 32:14</a>.A number of cities were named Mizpeh (Heb., <em>mits&#xB7;peh&#x2B9;, </em>&#x201C;Watchtower&#x201D;), probably because of being on high elevations or because of notable towers erected there. Sometimes the Bible distinguished these cities by naming their location, as &#x201C;Mizpeh of Gilead&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004581/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 11:29</a>) and &#x201C;Mizpeh in Moab.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004581/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 22:3</a>.A pile of stones was set up by Jacob and called &#x201C;Galeed&#x201D; (meaning &#x201C;Witness Heap&#x201D;) and &#x201C;The Watchtower.&#x201D; Laban then said: &#x201C;Let Jehovah keep watch between me and you when we are situated unseen the one from the other.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004581/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 31:45-49</a>) This pile of stones would testify to the fact that Jehovah was watching to see that Jacob and Laban carried out their covenant of peace."}
