Through his prophets God warned Israel of punishment for their disobedience, but he also gave comfort by foretelling that a remnant would be preserved, would return to Jerusalem and rebuild it, and would prosper and bear fruitage.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 1:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> 37:31, 32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/3/4\" data-bid=\"4-5\" class=\"b\"> Jer 23:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/3/5\" data-bid=\"4-6\" class=\"b\"> 31:7-9</a>.<span id=\"page770\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"770\" data-before-text=\"770\"></span>After King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had carried captives off with King Jehoiachin of Judah in 617&#xA0;B.C.E., Jehovah gave the prophet Jeremiah a vision. Good figs in the vision represented the exiles of Judah who were taken to Babylon and whom Jehovah would in time restore to their land. Bad figs represented King Zedekiah, his princes, and others like them that were not then taken into exile (actually the larger number of Jerusalem&#x2019;s and Judah&#x2019;s inhabitants) as well as those living in Egypt. In 607&#xA0;B.C.E. nearly all those in Judah were killed or exiled at the final destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. And later the ones in Egypt, including those who fled there after 607&#xA0;B.C.E., suffered when Nebuchadnezzar made a military excursion into that land.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 24:1-10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 44:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 46:13-17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> La 1:1-6</a>.Jehovah promised the faithful remnant, those who repented of their sins for which he let them go into exile, that he would collect them together as a flock in a pen. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 2:12</a>) This he did in 537&#xA0;B.C.E., with the return of a remnant of the Jews under Zerubbabel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 2:1,&#xA0;2</a>) They were formerly &#x201C;limping,&#x201D; but Jehovah gathered them, and (even though they were under Persian domination) because of having Governor Zerubbabel over them and because true worship was reestablished at the temple, God was again their real King.

This was actually because Babylon was the chief exponent of false worship and hated Jehovah and his worship. For these reasons God declared: &#x201C;I will cut off from Babylon name and remnant and progeny and posterity.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 14:22</a>) Eventually, Babylon became a complete and permanent desolation, with no remnant to return to rebuild her.<strong>A Remnant of Israel Accepts Christ. </strong>When Jesus Christ came to the nation of Israel the majority rejected him. Only a remnant expressed faith and became followers of him.

For Jehovah will make an accounting on the earth, concluding it and cutting it short.&#x2019; Also, just as Isaiah had said aforetime: &#x2018;Unless Jehovah of hosts had left a seed to us, we should have become just like Sodom, and we should have been made just like Gomorrah.&#x2019;&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 9:27-29</a>) Again Paul uses the example of the 7,000 left in Elijah&#x2019;s time who had not bowed to Baal, and he says: &#x201C;In this way, therefore, at the present season also a remnant has turned up according to a choosing due to undeserved kindness.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 11:5</a>.<strong>The Spiritual Remnant. </strong>In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation (12</a>) John recorded his vision of a woman in heaven, and a dragon, and concluded that part of the vision, saying: &#x201C;And the dragon grew wrathful at the woman, and went off to wage war with the remaining ones [<em>loi&#xB7;pon&#x2B9;</em>] of her seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.&#x201D; These &#x201C;remaining ones&#x201D; who have &#x201C;the work of bearing witness to Jesus&#x201D; are the last ones on earth of the brothers of Jesus Christ, living on earth after the hurling of the Devil down to the earth and the announcement: &#x201C;Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ.&#x201D; The Devil, the dragon, wars against this remnant of Christ&#x2019;s spiritual brothers by means of the &#x2018;wild beasts&#x2019; and &#x201C;the image of the wild beast,&#x201D; described in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003690/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation chapter&#xA0;13</a>.
