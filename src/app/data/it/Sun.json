Its average distance from the earth is over 149,600,000&#xA0;km (93,000,000&#xA0;mi). The surface temperature of the sun is said to be about 6,000&#xB0; C. (11,000&#xB0; F.).

It is about two weeks later that the moon is <em>new, </em>that is, in the same direction as the sun from the earth (the time when solar eclipses occur).Long before this occasion, Jehovah had demonstrated his ability to shut out the sunlight. This was when the Israelites were down in Egypt. During the ninth plague thick darkness enveloped the Egyptians with darkness that could &#x201C;be felt.&#x201D; It lasted for three days, longer than any eclipse of the sun by the moon.

It consisted of causing a shadow that had gradually fallen to reverse its direction and go back up ten steps. This could refer to the steps, or degrees, of a dial for measuring time, and it is not impossible that Hezekiah&#x2019;s father possessed such a sundial, even obtaining it from Babylon. However, the Jewish historian Josephus in discussing the account speaks of these steps of Ahaz as being &#x201C;in the house,&#x201D; apparently indicating that they formed part of a stairway. (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>X, 29 [ii,&#xA0;1]) There may have been a column placed alongside the stairs to receive the sun&#x2019;s rays and cause a shadow to extend gradually along the steps and serve as a measurement of time.The miracle performed could have involved the relationship between earth and sun, and if so, it could have been similar to the miracle recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004260/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 10:12-14</a>.
