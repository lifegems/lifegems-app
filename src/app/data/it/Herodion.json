Paul refers to Herodion as &#x201C;my relative.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002003/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 16:11</a>) Some suggest that this may simply mean that Herodion was a fellow Jew rather than an immediate member of Paul&#x2019;s family, in view of the apostle&#x2019;s use of the designation &#x201C;relatives&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002003/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 9:3</a>. However, since Paul does not refer to all the Jews to whom he sent greetings as &#x201C;my relatives&#x201D; (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002003/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 18:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002003/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 16:3</a>), likely a closer relative is meant.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002003/0\">ANDRONICUS</a>."}
