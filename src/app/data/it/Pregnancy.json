Extreme adversity befell pregnant women and those suckling babies when Roman forces laid siege to Jerusalem. Famine prevailed. During pregnancy it is important for a woman to have proper nourishment. If, for example, she does not get sufficient calcium, she might lose her teeth, as the body takes calcium to form the bones of the developing baby. Furthermore a woman&#x2019;s maternal protective instinct would increase her suffering as she saw infants starving and dying, all the while knowing that she would soon bring a child into such conditions. Josephus wrote about some starving men in besieged Jerusalem: &#x201C;There was no compassion for hoary hairs or infancy: children were actually lifted up with the fragments to which they clung and dashed to the ground.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Jewish War, </em>V, 433 (x,&#xA0;3); compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003546/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 23:29</a>.<strong>Figurative Use. </strong>The period of pregnancy culminating in the birth of a child is used several times in a figurative sense.

The process began with their allowing &#x201C;hurtful thoughts&#x201D; and wrong desires to impregnate their minds and hearts and, in effect, incubate there, with the inevitable result that &#x201C;hurtful works&#x201D; came to birth.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003546/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 1:14,&#xA0;15</a>.Elsewhere Isaiah depicts Israel as a woman crying out in labor pains and saying to God: &#x201C;So we have become because of you, O&#xA0;Jehovah.
