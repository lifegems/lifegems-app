There Jehovah miraculously provided a month&#x2019;s supply of quail for the entire camp. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002601/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:19, 20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002601/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;31</a>) But the people were so greedy that &#x201C;the one collecting least gathered ten homers&#x201D; (2,200&#xA0;L; 62&#xA0;bu). The record says that while &#x201C;the meat was yet between their teeth, before it could be chewed, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Jehovah began striking at the people with a very great slaughter.&#x201D; Instead of denoting literal chewing of a mouthful, this may mean before the entire provision of meat could be &#x201C;exhausted&#x201D; or &#x201C;consumed&#x201D; (<em>AT, RS</em>), because the Hebrew word translated &#x201C;chewed&#x201D; basically means &#x201C;cut off.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002601/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Joe 1:5</a>.) After this the dead were buried, and the place therefore came to be called Kibroth-hattaavah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002601/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:32-35</a>."}
