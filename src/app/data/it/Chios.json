The island measures some 50&#xA0;km (30&#xA0;mi) in length (N to S) and varies between 13 and 29&#xA0;km (8 to 18&#xA0;mi) in breadth (E to W).Chios is mentioned in the account in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000959/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 20</a> concerning Paul&#x2019;s return trip to Jerusalem at the close of his third missionary journey, in about 56&#xA0;C.E. The ship on which Paul was traveling left Mitylene (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000959/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:14</a>) some 100&#xA0;km (60&#xA0;mi) to the NE, probably in the morning, and &#x201C;arrived opposite Chios&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000959/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:15</a>), likely by sunset. Then, the following day, the voyage continued to Samos, approximately 100&#xA0;km (60&#xA0;mi) farther down the coast.At the time of Paul&#x2019;s journey Chios was considered a free city-state of the Roman province of Asia, a status it maintained until the reign of Emperor Vespasian (69-79&#xA0;C.E.). Both the island and its chief city are today called Khios by the Greeks and Scio by the Italians."}
