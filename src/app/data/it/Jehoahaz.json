(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002372/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 10:32-34</a>) And because Jehoahaz did what was bad in Jehovah&#x2019;s eyes, God allowed Hazael to continue to oppress Israel all the days of Jehoahaz, reducing his fighting force to a mere 50 horsemen, 10 chariots, and 10,000&#xA0;foot soldiers. Finally, Jehoahaz sought Jehovah&#x2019;s favor, and because of the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Jehovah did not allow Syria to bring Israel completely to ruin.
