As markers of the passing of time, the heavenly bodies serve as indicators of seasons. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003869/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:14</a>) <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003869/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 8:22</a> says that the earth&#x2019;s seasons will &#x201C;never cease.&#x201D; For a correlation of the months of the Jewish and Gregorian calendars and the festival, weather, and agricultural seasons, see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003869/0\">CALENDAR</a>.Closely connected with the agricultural seasons were the annual &#x201C;festival seasons&#x201D; when the festivals established by the Mosaic Law were celebrated.

Accordingly, it was the &#x201C;season&#x201D; to be awake.
