(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:33,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 19:1-9</a>) Today it is generally identified with Khirbet el-&#x2BD;Ater (Tel &#x2BD;Eter), about 1.5&#xA0;km (1&#xA0;mi) NW of Beit Jibrin (Eleutheropolis; Bet Guvrin). The account at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 19:7</a> is nearly parallel with that of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 4:32</a>, and in this latter text Ether appears to be referred to as Tochen.Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 15:42</a> being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-&#x2BD;Ater, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 19:7</a>, being situated near Ziklag to the S.&#xA0;While the other towns referred to in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 19:7</a> are all in the S and many of those at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001437/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 15:42</a> are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult."}
