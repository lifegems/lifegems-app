(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002711/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:4,&#xA0;5</a>) The Hebrew word <em>cha&#xB7;tsir&#x2B9;, </em>rendered &#x201C;leeks&#x201D; in this text, may possibly come from the same root as the identical Hebrew word translated &#x201C;green grass.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002711/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 40:7,&#xA0;8</a>) This item of diet is listed along with onions and garlic, specific plant foods very similar to leeks, indicating that a definite vegetable, rather than grass in general, is meant. Also, from ancient times leeks have enjoyed great popularity in Egypt and are still commonly eaten there as well as in Palestine.The leek (<em>Allium porrum</em>) is much like the onion but is distinguished from the latter by its milder flavor, slender cylindrical shape, and juicy, grasslike leaves measuring about 2.5&#xA0;cm (1&#xA0;in.) in width. The flower stem, terminating in a large compact ball of flowers, may attain a height of about 0.6&#xA0;m (2&#xA0;ft). The bulbs and leaves of this biennial plant are cooked as a vegetable and used as a seasoning; they are also eaten raw."}
