(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000137/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 30:1</a>) Nothing further is stated to enable further identification. He probably lived sometime during the period from Solomon&#x2019;s reign (1037-998&#xA0;B.C.E.) to Hezekiah&#x2019;s reign (745-717&#xA0;B.C.E.).Some rabbinic scholars have considered the name Agur to be allegorical, applying to Solomon. Thus the footnote on <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000137/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 30:1</a> in the <em>Soncino Books of the Bible </em>quotes from the Midrash as saying: &#x201C;He was called <em>Agur </em>because he stored up (<em>agar</em>) knowledge of Torah, and <em>the son of Jakeh </em>because he spewed it out (<em>hikki</em>) in that he ignored the warning against multiplying wives.&#x201D; (Edited by A.&#xA0;Cohen, London, 1952) Even among the Jewish commentators, however, this view was not unanimous, many holding that the change of style, language, and content indicates a different writer."}
