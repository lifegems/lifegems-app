(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001930/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 4:31</a>) A similar list of cities originally assigned to Judah has &#x201C;Sansannah&#x201D; in place of Hazar-susah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001930/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001930/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;31</a>) Some view them as separate locations, placing Sansannah to the NNE of Beer-sheba and Hazar-susah about 26&#xA0;km (16&#xA0;mi) to the W of Beer-sheba at Sbalat Abu Susein, near the Plains of Philistia. A number of scholars, however, view it as probable that Hazar-susah is simply a secondary name for Sansannah, such secondary name, by its meaning, describing a notable function of the place. If it is the same as Sansannah, Hazar-susah may tentatively be identified with Khirbet esh-Shamsaniyat to the NNE of Beer-sheba, a short distance from the suggested site of Madmannah (likely Beth-marcaboth), mentioned before (Hazar-susah, Hazar-susim, or Sansannah) in the foregoing texts.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001930/0\">BETH-MARCABOTH</a>."}
