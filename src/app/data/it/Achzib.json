(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000082/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:44</a>) It is understood to be the same as &#x201C;Chezib&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000082/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 38:5</a>, <em>KJ</em>), the birthplace of Judah&#x2019;s son Shelah. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000082/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 15:33</a> shows it to be in the hilly country of the Shephelah, and it is tentatively identified with Tell el-Beida (Horvat Lavnin) 5&#xA0;km (3&#xA0;mi) WSW of Adullam. Lachish, Moresheth-gath, and Mareshah (mentioned along with Achzib in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000082/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 1:13-15</a>) are all in that area. Cozeba, in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000082/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 4:22</a>, is generally considered to be the same as Achzib.<strong>2. </strong>A Phoenician coastal city in the territory of the tribe of Asher. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000082/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:29</a>) Asher, however, never succeeded in conquering it, nor the more important city of Acco (Acre) to the S, perhaps due to hindering action on the part of the Phoenician fleet. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000082/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:31,&#xA0;32</a>) Sennacherib of Assyria overran it in King Hezekiah&#x2019;s time and mentions it in his annals under the name Akzibi. In Greek and Roman times it was called Ecdippa. It has been identified with ez-Zib (Tel Akhziv), some 14&#xA0;km (9&#xA0;mi) N of Acco at the mouth of the Wadi Qarn (Nahal Keziv)."}
