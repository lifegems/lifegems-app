When Jehudi later read the same roll to Jehoiakim, the king cut it up and burned it, piece by piece, until the whole scroll was destroyed.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002405/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 36:14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002405/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 21-23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002405/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 27,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002405/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;32</a>.Jehudi was a great-grandson of Cushi.

However, those of the generations in between both have typical Jewish names (Nethaniah his father and Shelemiah his grandfather), and even the name Cushi itself is elsewhere found as a proper name of a natural-born Jew. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002405/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Zep 1:1</a>) So Jehudi was most likely simply a proper name given at birth and not a name first acquired as a proselyte."}
