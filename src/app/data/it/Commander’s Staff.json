The expression &#x201C;commander&#x2019;s staff&#x201D; appears four times in the <em>New World Translation, </em>translating the participle <em>mecho&#xB7;qeq&#x2B9;, </em>which is from the Hebrew root <em>cha&#xB7;qaq&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;inscribe&#x201D; or &#x201C;engrave&#x201D; and hence &#x201C;decree&#x201D; or &#x201C;enact.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 30:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Eze 4:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Pr 8:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Isa 10:1</a>) In ancient times, laws that were enacted were inscribed or engraved on stone or metal tablets. The same Hebrew word can apply to a commander who issues decrees, a &#x201C;statute-giver.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">De 33:21</a>) Without peer among legislators is Jehovah, the supreme &#x201C;Statute-giver.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 33:22</a>.When a commander was seated, his long staff would often rest upon the ground and lie back against the fold of his robe, between his knees. This fact lends meaning to Jacob&#x2019;s deathbed blessing of Judah: &#x201C;The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander&#x2019;s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:10</a>) Here the Hebrew word <em>mecho&#xB7;qeq&#x2B9; </em>has been rendered &#x201C;lawgiver&#x201D; in some translations (<em>KJ; Yg</em>), but its other meaning, &#x201C;commander&#x2019;s staff&#x201D; (<em>NW; Ro</em>), is more appropriate in this case and has the support of modern lexicographers. (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>by Koehler and Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;328; <em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, </em>by Brown, Driver, and Briggs, 1980, p.&#xA0;349) That an object and not a person is evidently intended at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 49:10</a> is the understanding conveyed in various translations, which have renderings such as &#x201C;ruler&#x2019;s staff&#x201D; (<em>AS; RS</em>), &#x201C;staff of sway&#x201D; (<em>Mo</em>), and &#x201C;staff&#x201D; (<em>AT</em>). A staff of some type, a &#x201C;commander&#x2019;s staff,&#x201D; also nicely parallels the &#x201C;scepter&#x201D; and goes with the phrase &#x201C;from between his feet&#x201D; appearing in the same verse. Similar usage is found at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Numbers 21:17, 18</a>, where a well is said to be excavated &#x201C;with a commander&#x2019;s staff, with their own staffs,&#x201D; though a possible reading there is, &#x201C;with a commander, with their rulers.&#x201D; At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 49:10</a> an alternate reading for &#x201C;neither the commander&#x2019;s staff&#x201D; is &#x201C;neither a commander.&#x201D;Since a scepter is a staff or rod, some might conclude that there is no difference between &#x201C;the scepter&#x201D; and &#x201C;the commander&#x2019;s staff&#x201D; of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 49:10</a>. However, it appears that Jacob intended to make a distinction between them. Parallel terms <span id=\"page492\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"492\" data-before-text=\"492\"></span>are often employed in poetic expressions. Though they are similar, upon closer examination one term is seen to convey to the mind a thought that is slightly different from what the other conveys, and that frequently enhances one&#x2019;s understanding of what has been said. Jacob seems to have used such a device in blessing his sons. For example, he stated that Dan would &#x201C;prove to be a <em>serpent </em>by the roadside, a <em>horned snake </em>at the wayside&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:17</a>), using these parallel expressions in a good sense to indicate that Dan would be a peril to the foes of Israel.God himself is identified as saying: &#x201C;Judah is my commander&#x2019;s staff.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 60:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 108:8</a>) While holding the commander&#x2019;s staff indicates that the possessor would be a leader with the power to command, a scepter in a monarch&#x2019;s hand signifies his possession of regal sovereignty or prerogative as a royal ruler. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 45:6</a>) Therefore, the use of the terms &#x201C;scepter&#x201D; and &#x201C;commander&#x2019;s staff&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 49:10</a> evidently indicates that significant authority and power would reside with the tribe of Judah. But that more than tribal authority and dominance were involved is clear since Shiloh, to whom &#x201C;the obedience of the peoples will belong,&#x201D; was to come from the tribe of Judah. That circumstance betokens royal authority and power over the people. When Judah&#x2019;s descendant David became the king of Israel, the scepter and commander&#x2019;s staff proved to be in the possession of the tribe of Judah, and these would not depart from it until the coming of Shiloh, the Messiah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 7:8-16</a>) God has indeed given the Shiloh to come, Jesus Christ, a descendant of Judah and David, as &#x201C;a leader and commander to the national groups.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 55:4</a>) It was foretold that the Messianic Ruler would exercise dominance and power over the nations and peoples. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 2:8,&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> Da 7:13,&#xA0;14</a>) Hence, he not only holds &#x201C;the scepter,&#x201D; or royal sovereignty, but also possesses &#x201C;the commander&#x2019;s staff,&#x201D; having the power to command.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001013/0\">SHILOH</a> No.&#xA0;1."}
