He therefore consulted with the older men of Midian and then sent messengers, older men of both Moab and Midian, to hire the prophet Balaam to come and curse Israel.

There Boaz, a kinsman of Elimelech, married Ruth, who had abandoned the polytheism of the Moabites and had become a worshiper of Jehovah. Thus Ruth, a Moabitess, became an ancestress of David and therefore also of Jesus Christ.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Ru 1:1-6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/36/1\" data-bid=\"37-2\" class=\"b\"> 15-17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/36/2\" data-bid=\"37-3\" class=\"b\"> 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/36/3\" data-bid=\"37-4\" class=\"b\"> 4:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/36/4\" data-bid=\"37-5\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;17</a>.Also in the time of the Judges, Israel began venerating the deities of the Moabites, doubtless including their god Chemosh.

The Moabites were completely subdued and were made to pay tribute to David. Apparently at the end of the conflict two thirds of Moab&#x2019;s fighting men were put to death.

(PICTURE, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;946) If correctly identified as being the same places mentioned in the Bible, 10 of the cities that King Mesha claims as subject to or captured by or (re)built by him were definitely in Israelite territory N of the Arnon. These cities are Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, Kiriathaim, Nebo, Baal-meon (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 32:34,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/49/1\" data-bid=\"50-2\" class=\"b\"> 37,&#xA0;38</a>), Medeba, Bamoth-baal, Jahaz (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/50/1\" data-bid=\"51-2\" class=\"b\"> 17-19</a>), and Bezer (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 20:8</a>).Unlike Mesha&#x2019;s propagandistic inscription, the Scriptures report that the Moabites suffered humiliating defeat. Enlisting the aid of King Jehoshaphat of Judah and the king of Edom in putting down the Moabite revolt, Jehoram (who became king of Israel about two years after Ahab&#x2019;s death) marched against Moab from the S, by way of the Wilderness of Edom. But the allied armies and their animals almost perished for lack of water. The prophet Elisha&#x2019;s aid was then sought, and in fulfillment of his prophecy that Jehovah would help on account of Jehoshaphat, the torrent valley <span id=\"page421\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"421\" data-before-text=\"421\"></span>became filled with water. The next morning the reflection of the sun upon the water made it look like blood to the Moabites. Wrongly concluding that the allied armies had slaughtered one another, the Moabites abandoned all caution and came to the Israelite camp, only to be put to flight. As the battle progressed, Moabite cities were ruined, good tracts of land were filled with stones, trees were cut down, and springs were stopped up. When King Mesha found himself penned up in the city of Kir-hareseth with the battle going against him, he, with 700 men, unsuccessfully tried to break through to the king of Edom. Finally he took his firstborn son and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice upon the wall. For this or some other reason there &#x201C;came to be great indignation against Israel&#x201D; and the siege was abandoned.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 3:6-27</a>.As this humiliating defeat did not take place on foreign soil but brought devastation to the land of Moab, reasonably a considerable period of time would have been required for recovery. So it seems likely that it was at an earlier date during Jehoshaphat&#x2019;s reign that Moab combined with the forces of Ammon and the mountainous region of Seir to attack Judah. By Jehovah&#x2019;s intervention the three armies turned on one another and destroyed themselves. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 20:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/53/1\" data-bid=\"54-2\" class=\"b\"> 22-24</a>) Some scholars believe that this event is alluded to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 83:4-9</a>.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 20:14</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Ps&#xA0;83:Sup</a>.In subsequent years enmity continued between Moab and Israel. After the death of the prophet Elisha, marauding bands of Moabites regularly invaded Israel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 13:20</a>) About two centuries later, in Jehoiakim&#x2019;s time, similar Moabite bands contributed to the ruin of Judah during its final years. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 24:2</a>) With the destruction of Jerusalem in 607&#xA0;B.C.E., Jews sought refuge in Moab, returning to Judah when Gedaliah was appointed governor.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 40:11,&#xA0;12</a>.<strong><em>After the exile. </em></strong>After an Israelite remnant returned from Babylonian exile in 537&#xA0;B.C.E., some married Moabite wives. But at Ezra&#x2019;s admonition they dismissed these wives and their children.

(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 11:14</a>.) Condemned for reproaching Israel and for pride and haughtiness, Moab was finally to become a desolation like Sodom. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/63/0\" data-bid=\"64-1\" class=\"b\">Zep 2:8-11</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/64/0\" data-bid=\"65-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 48:29</a>.) Already at the close of the ninth century B.C.E., Amos wrote that Moab would suffer calamity for &#x201C;burning the bones of the king of Edom for lime.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/65/0\" data-bid=\"66-1\" class=\"b\">Am 2:1-3</a>) While some take this to mean that <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/66/0\" data-bid=\"67-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Kings 3:26, 27</a> refers to King Mesha&#x2019;s offering up, not his own son, but the firstborn of the king of Edom, this is an unlikely inference. One Jewish tradition, though, does link the event mentioned by Amos with the war waged against Mesha and claims that sometime after this conflict the Moabites dug up the bones of the king of Edom and then burned them for lime. But the Bible record provides no basis for determining the time involved.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/67/0\" data-bid=\"68-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah (chaps 15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/67/1\" data-bid=\"68-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;16</a>), apparently around the time of King Ahaz&#x2019; death and while Assyria dominated in the eighth century B.C.E., referred to one Moabite city after another as being in line for calamity. He concluded with the words: &#x201C;And now Jehovah has spoken, saying: &#x2018;Within three years, according to the years of a hired laborer, the glory of Moab must also be disgraced with much commotion of every sort, and those who remain over will be a trifling few, not mighty.&#x2019;&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/68/0\" data-bid=\"69-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 16:14</a>.From historical records the fulfillment of the prophecies of Isaiah and Amos cannot be placed precisely in the stream of time. However, there is evidence that Moab did come under the Assyrian yoke. Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III mentions Salamanu of Moab among those paying tribute to him. Sennacherib claims to have received tribute from Kammusunadbi the king of Moab. And Assyrian monarchs Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal refer to Moabite Kings Musuri and Kamashaltu as being subject to them. (<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Pritchard, 1974, pp.&#xA0;282, 287, 291, 294, 298) There is also archaeological evidence that many places in Moab were depopulated about the eighth century B.C.E.Jeremiah&#x2019;s prophecy of the seventh century B.C.E. pointed to the time when Jehovah would hold an accounting against Moab (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/69/0\" data-bid=\"70-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 9:25,&#xA0;26</a>), doing so by means of the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/70/0\" data-bid=\"71-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 25:8, 9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/70/1\" data-bid=\"71-2\" class=\"b\"> 17-21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/70/2\" data-bid=\"71-3\" class=\"b\"> 27:1-7</a>) Numerous Moabite cities were to be reduced to a desolation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/71/0\" data-bid=\"72-1\" class=\"b\">Jer&#xA0;48</a>) Apparently when Judah experienced the execution of Jehovah&#x2019;s judgment by means of the Babylonians, the Moabites said: &#x201C;Look! The house of Judah is like all the other nations.&#x201D; For thus failing to recognize that the judgment was really God&#x2019;s and that the inhabitants of Judah were his people, the Moabites were to experience disaster and thereby &#x2018;come to know Jehovah.&#x2019;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/72/0\" data-bid=\"73-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 25:8-11</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/73/0\" data-bid=\"74-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 24:1,&#xA0;2</a>.The Jewish historian Josephus writes that, in the fifth year after desolating Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar returned to war against Coele-Syria, Ammon, and Moab and thereafter attacked Egypt. <span id=\"page422\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"422\" data-before-text=\"422\"></span>(<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>X, 181, 182 [ix,&#xA0;7]) Regarding archaeological confirmation of the desolation of Moab, <em>The Interpreter&#x2019;s Dictionary of the Bible </em>observes: &#x201C;Archaeological exploration has shown that Moab was largely depopulated from <em>ca. </em>the beginning of the sixth century, and in many sites from <em>ca. </em>the eighth century. From the sixth century on, nomads wandered through the land until political and economic factors made sedentary life possible again in the last centuries B.C.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Edited by G.&#xA0;A.&#xA0;Buttrick, 1962, Vol.&#xA0;3, p.&#xA0;418; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/74/0\" data-bid=\"75-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 25:8-11</a>.Later, in fulfillment of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/75/0\" data-bid=\"76-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 48:47</a>, Cyrus, the conqueror of Babylon, likely permitted Moabite exiles to return to their homeland.The accurate fulfillment of the prophecies concerning Moab cannot be denied. Centuries ago the Moabites ceased to exist as a people. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/76/0\" data-bid=\"77-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 48:42</a>) Today what are considered to have been such Moabite cities as Nebo, Heshbon, Aroer, Beth-gamul, and Baal-meon are represented by ruins. Many other places are now unknown.The sole explanation for the disappearance of the Moabites as a people is provided by the Bible. Noted the 1959 edition of the <em>Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica </em>(Vol.&#xA0;15, p.&#xA0;629): &#x201C;Israel remained a great power while Moab disappeared. It is true that Moab was continuously hard pressed by desert hordes; the exposed condition of the land is emphasized by the chains of ruined forts and castles which even the Romans were compelled to construct. But the explanation is to be found within Israel itself, and especially in the work of the prophets.&#x201D;In view of the disappearance of the Moabites as a people, the inclusion of Moab at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/77/0\" data-bid=\"78-1\" class=\"b\">Daniel 11:41</a> among nations in &#x201C;the time of the end&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/78/0\" data-bid=\"79-1\" class=\"b\">Da 11:40</a>) is logically to be regarded in a figurative sense. The Moabites evidently refer to some of those that &#x201C;the king of the north&#x201D; does not succeed in bringing under his control.For information on the Moabite Stone, see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/1\">MESHA</a> No.&#xA0;2."}
