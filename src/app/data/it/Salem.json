(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003800/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:18</a>) The Hebrew spelling of &#x201C;Salem,&#x201D; as incorporated in the name Jerusalem, suggests a dual form and, therefore, the word may be defined as &#x201C;Twofold Peace.&#x201D; That the name means &#x201C;Peace&#x201D; is confirmed by the inspired words of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003800/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 7:2</a>.Ancient Jewish tradition identifies Salem with Jerusalem, and Scriptural evidence supports this. Abraham met the king of Sodom and Melchizedek in &#x201C;the king&#x2019;s Low Plain.&#x201D; Since King David&#x2019;s son Absalom centuries later erected a monument there, this low plain must have been near Jerusalem, the capital of the kingdom.
