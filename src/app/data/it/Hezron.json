However, some scholars believe that the Masoretic text does not preserve the original reading, since Hezron is <span id=\"page1106\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1106\" data-before-text=\"1106\"></span>listed among the 70 &#x201C;souls of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt&#x201D; and so must have died in that land (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002015/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 46:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002015/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 26,&#xA0;27</a>), and it seems to them unlikely that a place in Egypt bore the Hebrew name Caleb-ephrathah.

The Jerusalem Bible </em>renders this text: &#x201C;After Hezron&#x2019;s death, Caleb married Ephrathah, wife of Hezron his father, who bore him Ashhur, father of Tekoa.&#x201D; The translation by J.&#xA0;B.&#xA0;Rotherham reads: &#x201C;And after the death of Hezron Caleb entered Ephrathah, and the wife of Hezron was Abiah who bare him Ashhur father of Tekoa.&#x201D; So, according to these alterations, &#x201C;Ashhur&#x201D; is either the &#x201C;son&#x201D; of Hezron by Abiah (Abijah) or the &#x201C;son&#x201D; of Caleb by Ephrathah.<strong>3. </strong>A city on the southern border of Judah situated between Kadesh-barnea and Addar.
