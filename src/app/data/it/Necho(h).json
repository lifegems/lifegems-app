According to the Greek historian Herodotus (II, 158, <span id=\"page483\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"483\" data-before-text=\"483\"></span>159;&#xA0;IV,&#xA0;42), Nechos (Necho) was the son of Psammetichus (Psammetichos, Psamtik I) and succeeded his father as ruler of Egypt. Although beginning construction work on a canal linking the Nile with the Red Sea, he did not complete this project. However, he did send a Phoenician fleet on a voyage around Africa. This journey was successfully completed in three years.Toward the close of Josiah&#x2019;s 31-year reign (659-629&#xA0;B.C.E.), Pharaoh Necho was on his way to help the Assyrians at the river Euphrates. At that time Josiah disregarded &#x201C;the words of Necho from the mouth of God&#x201D; and was mortally wounded while attempting to turn the Egyptian forces back at Megiddo. About three months later, Pharaoh Necho took Jehoahaz, Josiah&#x2019;s successor to the throne, captive and made 25-year-old Eliakim his vassal, changing the new ruler&#x2019;s name to Jehoiakim. Necho also imposed a heavy fine on the kingdom of Judah.
