This area is narrower and less distinct than the Judean Shephelah.

A footnote in a commentary by C.&#xA0;F.&#xA0;Keil and F.&#xA0;Delitzsch observes: &#x201C;The distinction .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. may be explained without difficulty even from the circumstances of Joshua&#x2019;s own time. Judah and the double tribe of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) received their inheritance by lot before any of the others. But whilst the tribe of Judah proceeded into the territory allotted to them in the south, all the other tribes still remained in Gilgal; and even at a later period, when Ephraim and Manasseh were in their possessions, all Israel, with the exception of Judah, were still encamped at Shiloh. Moreover, the two parts of the nation were now separated by the territory which was afterwards assigned to the tribe of Benjamin, but had no owner at this time; and in addition to this, the altar, tabernacle, and ark of the covenant were in the midst of Joseph and the other tribes that were still assembled at Shiloh.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Commentary on the Old Testament, </em>1973, Vol.&#xA0;II, Joshua, pp.&#xA0;124, 125."}
