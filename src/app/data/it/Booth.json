Branches of poplar, olive, and oil trees as well as the leaves of the palm and the fragrant myrtle were used in their construction. This was to remind Israel that Jehovah made them dwell in booths when he brought them up out of Egypt.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Le 23:34,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 40-43;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Ne 8:15</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/0\">FESTIVAL OF BOOTHS</a>.Booths were also used for a number of practical purposes. Jacob made booths under which to shelter his herd, and he affixed to that place the name Succoth, meaning &#x201C;Booths.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 33:17</a>) Booths were used by armies in the field, especially by the officers.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 20:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;16</a>.A booth, or hut, was often built in a vineyard or in the center of a field so that the watchman could have shelter from the hot sun as he kept guard against thieves or animals.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 1:8</a>) Jehovah pictures himself as dwelling in a booth of clouds when he temporarily descends from heaven to earth. There majestic omnipotence conceals itself, and from there come the crashings of thunder.

Regarding the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah and its last king Zedekiah of the line of David, Ezekiel was inspired to prophesy: &#x201C;A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I shall make it. As for this also, it will certainly become no one&#x2019;s until he comes who has the legal right, and I must give it to him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000790/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 21:27</a>) From this time on no king of the line of David occupied &#x201C;Jehovah&#x2019;s throne&#x201D; in Jerusalem.
