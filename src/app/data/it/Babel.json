Because of an absence of lime, the mortar consisted of bitumen.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000529/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:3</a>.Babel&#x2019;s God-defying program centered around construction of a religious tower &#x201C;with its top in the heavens.&#x201D; It was not built for the worship and praise of Jehovah, but was dedicated to false man-made religion, with a motive of making a &#x201C;celebrated name&#x201D; for the builders.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000529/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:4</a>.The approximate time of such building may be drawn from the following information: Peleg lived from 2269 to 2030&#xA0;B.C.E.
