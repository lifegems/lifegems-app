(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 11:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 23:34</a>) As David&#x2019;s personal adviser, Ahithophel&#x2019;s sagacious counsel was esteemed as if it were the direct word of Jehovah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 16:23</a>) Later this once-close companion treacherously turned traitor and joined David&#x2019;s son Absalom in a coup against the king. As a ringleader in the rebellion, he advised Absalom to violate David&#x2019;s concubines, and he asked permission to raise an army of 12,000 and immediately hunt down and kill David while David was in a disorganized and weakened state. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 15:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> 17:1-4</a>) When Jehovah thwarted this bold scheme, and the counsel of Hushai was followed, Ahithophel evidently realized that Absalom&#x2019;s revolt would fail. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 15:32-34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 17:5-14</a>) He committed suicide and was <span id=\"page66\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"66\" data-before-text=\"66\"></span>buried with his forefathers. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 17:23</a>) Apart from wartime, this is the only case of suicide mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. His traitorous act is apparently recalled in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 55:12-14</a>."}
