Omri purchased the mountain, on top of which this city was built, from Shemer, for two talents of silver, a price equal to $13,212. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 16:23,&#xA0;24</a>) The mountain as well as the city continued to be called after the name of this former owner.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Am 4:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 6:1</a>.<strong>Location. </strong>Samaria is identified with ruins called Shomeron adjacent to the Arab village Sabastiya, about 55&#xA0;km (34&#xA0;mi) N of Jerusalem, and 11&#xA0;km (7&#xA0;mi) NW of Shechem. It was in Manasseh&#x2019;s territory. When Samaria was described as &#x201C;the head&#x201D; of Ephraim, the reference was to its position as the capital of the ten-tribe kingdom, Ephraim being the dominant tribe of that kingdom. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 7:9</a>) Samaria was near to, if not the same location as, &#x201C;Shamir in the mountainous region of Ephraim,&#x201D; the home of Judge Tola, who served during the period of the Judges.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 10:1,&#xA0;2</a>.The rather flat top of the Samarian hill, about 2&#xA0;km (1&#xA0;mi) across from E to W, was an ideal location for a city. The abrupt rise of about 90&#xA0;m (300&#xA0;ft) from the plain below made the location easy to defend. The view too was magnificent, for to the N, E, and S were higher peaks, while to the W the land gently sloped down from an altitude of 463&#xA0;m (1,519&#xA0;ft) to the blue Mediterranean, 34&#xA0;km (21&#xA0;mi) away.Much of Samaria&#x2019;s history is bound up with the wayward record of the 14 kings of Israel from Omri to Hoshea.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 16:28, 29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 22:51, 52;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 3:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:35, 36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/4\" data-bid=\"5-5\" class=\"b\"> 13:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/5\" data-bid=\"5-6\" class=\"b\"> 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/6\" data-bid=\"5-7\" class=\"b\"> 14:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/7\" data-bid=\"5-8\" class=\"b\"> 15:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/8\" data-bid=\"5-9\" class=\"b\"> 13, 14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/9\" data-bid=\"5-10\" class=\"b\"> 17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/10\" data-bid=\"5-11\" class=\"b\"> 23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/11\" data-bid=\"5-12\" class=\"b\"> 25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/12\" data-bid=\"5-13\" class=\"b\"> 27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/4/13\" data-bid=\"5-14\" class=\"b\"> 17:1</a>.<strong>During Time of Ahab. </strong>After the death of Omri, his son Ahab continued the city&#x2019;s building program during his 22-year reign. This included the construction of a Baal temple, the setting up a Baal altar, and the erection of &#x201C;the sacred pole&#x201D; of worship<wbr>&#x2014;all evidence, in this newly created city, of the Canaanite religion sponsored by Ahab&#x2019;s Phoenician wife Jezebel.

However, the Israelites were given the victory in order that Ahab should know that Jehovah is God Almighty. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 20:1-21</a>) In a second encounter less than a year later, when Ben-hadad was forced to surrender, Ahab let him go on the promise that cities would be returned to Israel and &#x2018;streets in Damascus would be assigned&#x2019; to Ahab the same as Ben-hadad&#x2019;s father had assigned himself streets in Samaria. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 20:26-34</a>) These &#x201C;streets&#x201D; evidently had been for the establishment of bazaars, or markets, to promote the commercial interests of Ben-hadad&#x2019;s father. Nevertheless, Ahab returned to Samaria sad and dejected, for, since he had spared Ben-hadad&#x2019;s life, Jehovah told him he would forfeit his own.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 20:35-43</a>.This forfeiture came about in the third year after that when Ahab invited Judean King Jehoshaphat to help him recover Ramoth-gilead from Syria. The two kings formally held court at the entrance of Samaria and, after ignoring Jehovah&#x2019;s prophet and listening to the deceptive counsel of false prophets, set out for the battle.

Ahab bled to death in his chariot. He was returned to his capital for burial, and the chariot was washed out alongside the pool of Samaria.

For example, Ahab&#x2019;s son Ahaziah fell through the grating in his palace roof chamber in Samaria (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 1:2-17</a>), the Syrian leper Naaman came to Samaria seeking a cure (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 5:1-14</a>), and the Syrian military force, sent out to capture Elisha, was mentally blinded and led to Samaria, where the men were fed and sent home (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 6:13-23</a>). During the reign of Ahab&#x2019;s son Jehoram, the Syrians besieged Samaria, causing such a famine that some persons ate their own children. But then, in fulfillment of Elisha&#x2019;s prophecy, the famine was broken in one night when Jehovah caused the Syrians to flee in panic and leave behind their foodstuffs.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 6:24-29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> 7:1-20</a>.<strong>Rival of Jerusalem. </strong>From time to time the rivalry and animosity between Samaria and Jerusalem, the respective capitals of the northern and southern kingdoms, burst into open warfare. On one occasion the king of Judah, when about to attack Edom, sent 100,000 mercenaries of Israel back home on orders from Jehovah. And even though paid 100 silver talents ($660,600), these Israelites were so enraged that they raided and plundered Judean towns &#x201C;from Samaria clear to Beth-horon.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 25:5-13</a>) The king of Judah, flushed with victory over Edom, then picked a quarrel with the king of Samaria, a quarrel that was not settled until all the gold and silver from the house of Jehovah and the king&#x2019;s treasury in Jerusalem had been carried off to Samaria.

Shalmaneser&#xA0;V, king of Assyria, laid siege to Samaria, but the city was able to hold out for nearly three years. When it finally fell in 740&#xA0;B.C.E., many of the leading inhabitants were deported into exile and settled in Mesopotamia and Media. Whether credit for the ultimate capture of the city goes to Shalmaneser&#xA0;V or to his successor Sargon&#xA0;II is still not a settled question.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:1-6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/29/1\" data-bid=\"30-2\" class=\"b\"> 22, 23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/29/2\" data-bid=\"30-3\" class=\"b\"> 18:9-12</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/0\">SARGON</a>.With the fall of Samaria to the Assyrians, the Bible&#x2019;s detailed history of the city ends. Thereafter, mention of the city is often, though not always (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 23:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/30/1\" data-bid=\"31-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 8:5</a>), made by way of a reminder of what becomes of those who rebel against Jehovah.

Ishmael slaughtered many of these men, sparing some of them who promised to show him where they had treasures of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 41:1-9</a>.Secular records relate some of Samaria&#x2019;s history from and after the days of Alexander the Great. <span id=\"page847\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"847\" data-before-text=\"847\"></span>In Roman times its splendor was due to the building program of Herod the Great, who renamed the city Sebaste (a feminine Greek form for the Latin name Augustus), in honor of Augustus, the first emperor. Today the Arabic name Sabastiya preserves the name Herod gave it. It is therefore not surprising that excavations at this site have uncovered the remains of a number of different periods in its history; some of these remains are from the days of Israel&#x2019;s kings.<strong>2. </strong>The territory of the ten-tribe northern kingdom of Israel. The name of its capital city, Samaria, was sometimes applied to this entire area. For example, when Ahab was called &#x201C;the king of Samaria,&#x201D; it was not with the restricted meaning of being king of the city only, but in the broader sense as king of the ten tribes. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 21:1</a>) So, too, &#x201C;the cities of Samaria&#x201D; referred to those scattered throughout the ten tribes, not to towns clustered around the capital.

The famine &#x201C;in Samaria&#x201D; in the days of Ahab was extensive throughout the whole kingdom of Samaria and, in fact, even took in Phoenicia, extending at least from the torrent valley of Cherith, E of the Jordan, to Zarephath on the Mediterranean.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:6</a>) But this time the king of Assyria replaced these Israelites with people from other parts of his realm, a transplanting policy continued by Esar-haddon and Asenappar (Ashurbanipal).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> Ezr 4:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/40/2\" data-bid=\"41-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;10</a>.Lions began to multiply in the land, probably because the land, or a large part of it, had lain waste for a time. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 23:29</a>.) The settlers doubtless felt, superstitiously, that it was because they did not understand how to worship the god of the land. Therefore the king of Assyria sent back a calf-worshiping Israelite priest from exile. He taught the settlers about Jehovah, but in the same manner as Jeroboam had done, so that they learned something about Jehovah but actually continued to worship their own false gods.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:24-41</a>.<strong>3. </strong>The Roman district through which Jesus occasionally traveled and into which the apostles later brought the message of Christianity. Its boundaries are not definitely known today, but, generally, it lay between Galilee in the N and Judea in the S, and it extended W from the Jordan to the coastal plains of the Mediterranean. For the most part the district embraced the territories once belonging to the tribe of Ephraim and half the tribe of Manasseh (W of the Jordan).From time to time, on his way to and from Jerusalem, Jesus passed through Samaria, situated as it was between the districts of Judea and Galilee.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:8,&#xA0;9</a>) So it was that when persecution broke out in Jerusalem the disciples, Philip in particular, took up the ministry in Samaria. Peter and John were later sent there, resulting in further expansion of Christianity.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 8:1-17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> 25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/46/2\" data-bid=\"47-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003816/46/3\" data-bid=\"47-4\" class=\"b\"> 15:3</a>.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;846]</strong>Roman ruins at ancient Samaria"}
