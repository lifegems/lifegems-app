(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 94:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 20:12</a>) The ear consists of three parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The middle ear is a small chamber that begins with the eardrum and leads to the maze of passageways that constitute the inner ear. Besides its function in connection with hearing, the inner ear also possesses organs having to do with balance and motion. The use of two ears greatly helps a person to locate the source and direction of sounds.The human ear detects sounds within the range of about 20 to 20,000 cycles per second. The ears of many animals are sensitive to tones of higher pitch that are inaudible to the human ear. The range of sound energy perceived by the human ear is remarkable. The loudest sound that the ear can tolerate without danger is two million million times as powerful as the least perceptible sound. The human ear has the maximum sensitivity that it is practical to possess, for if the ears were any keener they would respond to the unceasing molecular motions of the air particles themselves.Since the Maker of the ear can hear, the Bible speaks of him as possessing ears, symbolically.

The term is used with respect to the faculty of hearing and then weighing the truthfulness and value of what is spoken. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 12:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 34:3</a>) The way the expression &#x201C;give ear&#x201D; or &#x2018;incline one&#x2019;s ear&#x2019; is used indicates that it means to pay attention with a view to acting on that which is heard.

This expression, as well as the phrase &#x2018;disclose to the ear,&#x2019; refers to the giving of information in private or the revealing of a secret or something not previously known.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 9:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 12, 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/9/3\" data-bid=\"10-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 7:27</a>.An &#x2018;awakened ear&#x2019; is one that is made attentive.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 33:15</a>) Similarly, the Greek word for &#x201C;listen&#x201D; may have the sense of &#x2018;giving attention to, understanding, and acting upon,&#x2019; as when Jesus Christ said: &#x201C;My sheep listen to my voice,&#x201D; and, &#x201C;a stranger they will by no means follow but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 10:27,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;5</a>.On the other hand, the ears of the rebellious ones are said to be &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; (<em>KJ</em>) or &#x201C;unresponsive.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 6:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 28:27</a>) Such wicked ones are likened to the cobra that stops up its ears, refusing to listen to the voice of the charmer.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 58:4</a>.Jehovah, through his servants, spoke of the stubborn, disobedient Israelites as having &#x2018;uncircumcised ears.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 6:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 7:51</a>) They are as though stopped up with something that impedes hearing. They are ears that have not been opened by Jehovah, who gives ears of understanding and obedience to those who seek him but allows the spiritual hearing of the disobedient ones to become dulled.

When what was said in the two verses is properly understood, there is no contradiction. The Greek word for &#x201C;voice&#x201D; (<em>pho&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;</em>) at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 9:7</a> is in the genitive case (<em>pho&#xB7;nes&#x2B9;</em>) and gives, in this verse, the sense of hearing <em>of </em>a voice<wbr>&#x2014;hearing the sound but not understanding. At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 22:9</a> <em>pho&#xB7;ne&#x2B9; </em>is in the accusative case (<em>pho&#xB7;nen&#x2B9;</em>): the men &#x201C;did not hear the voice&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;they heard the sound of a voice but did not get the words, the meaning; they did not understand what Jesus was saying to Saul, as Saul did. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 9:4</a>) This knowledge of the Bible&#x2019;s use of the idea of &#x2018;hearing&#x2019; in both senses helps to clear up what would otherwise seem to be discrepancies.At the installation of the priesthood in Israel, Moses was commanded to take some of the blood of the ram of the installation and put it on the lobe of the right ear of Aaron and of each of his sons, as well as on the right hand and right foot, indicating that what they listened to, the work they did, and the way they walked should be directly affected by what was there taking place. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Le 8:22-24</a>) Similarly, in the case of the cleansed leper, the Law said that the priest was to put some of the blood of the ram offered as a guilt offering, as well as some of the oil offered, on the lobe of the leper&#x2019;s right ear.

In such case the slave was to be brought to the doorpost, and his master was to pierce his ear through with an awl. This prominent mark, being made on the organ for hearing, evidently represented the slave&#x2019;s desire to continue in obedient attention to his master.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001236/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:5,&#xA0;6</a>.Regarding man&#x2019;s great need to hear God, in the sense of giving close attention and obedience to his words as the Bible directs, rather than to see God as some demand, R.&#xA0;C.&#xA0;Dentan remarks: &#x201C;In the Bible, the key word for man&#x2019;s response to God is &#x2018;hearing&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;seeing&#x2019; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. For the mystery religions the highest religious experience was that of &#x2018;seeing&#x2019; the god; but for the Bible, where the basic religious attitude is obedience to the divine word, the emphasis is on &#x2018;hearing&#x2019; his voice.
