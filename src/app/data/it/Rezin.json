(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003721/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 15:36-38</a>) During the warfare, which continued into the reign of Ahaz, the Syrians, evidently under Rezin, captured many Judeans and took them to Damascus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003721/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 28:5</a>) Also, Rezin wrested from Judah the city of Elath on the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba, clearing out the Jews and restoring the city to the Edomites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003721/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 16:6</a>) The combined Syro-Israelite forces laid siege to Jerusalem, intending to make &#x201C;the son of Tabeel&#x201D; its king, but they were unable to capture the city.
