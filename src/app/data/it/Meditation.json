Isaac, for example, went out walking alone in the early evening to meditate, possibly about his coming marriage to Rebekah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 24:63</a>) It was during the solitude of the night watches that the psalmist meditated on the greatness of his Grand Creator. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 63:6</a>) The meditations of the heart should be focused on beneficial things, on Jehovah&#x2019;s splendor and activities, on things pleasing to him (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 19:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 49:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 77:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 143:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/2/4\" data-bid=\"3-5\" class=\"b\"> Php 4:8</a>), and not on the devices of the wicked.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 24:1,&#xA0;2</a>.By engaging in profitable meditation, one will not be inclined to give foolish answers. He will seriously think out these matters of importance, and as a result, the answers given will be from the heart and will not be something to regret later on.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 15:28</a>.When Joshua was appointed as the overseer of the nation of Israel, he was instructed to make a copy of Jehovah&#x2019;s law, and he was told (as rendered in many Bible versions) to &#x201C;meditate&#x201D; thereon day and night.

Reading in an undertone would impress more indelibly on the mind the material on which one was meditating. <em>Gesenius&#x2019;s Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon </em>(translated by S.&#xA0;Tregelles, 1901, p.&#xA0;215) says of <em>ha&#xB7;ghah&#x2B9;: </em>&#x201C;Prop[erly] to speak with oneself, murmuring and in a low voice, as is often done by those who are musing.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 35:28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 37:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 71:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/10/3\" data-bid=\"11-4\" class=\"b\"> Isa 8:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/10/4\" data-bid=\"11-5\" class=\"b\"> 33:18</a>.The apostle Paul told Timothy that he should ponder over or be meditating on his conduct, ministry, and teaching.

These prayed to God, referring to David&#x2019;s prophetic words, saying: &#x201C;&#x2018;Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things?&#x2019; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, in order to do what things your hand and counsel had foreordained to occur.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 4:1-3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/12/2\" data-bid=\"13-3\" class=\"b\"> 21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/12/3\" data-bid=\"13-4\" class=\"b\"> 23-28</a>.The &#x201C;empty things&#x201D; here spoken of are shown by the context to be, not the things that people ordinarily seek in life, but things that are devoid of all good<wbr>&#x2014;actually thinking, speaking, and attempting to fight against Jehovah and his servants&#x2014;<wbr>utterly futile things.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 4:25</a>.King David said of those who hated him and sought his death: &#x201C;Deceptions they keep muttering [form of <em>ha&#xB7;ghah&#x2B9;</em>] all day long.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002958/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 38:12</a>) These meditations were not mere passing thoughts. They were deeply rooted in the heart, their inclination being toward that wicked pursuit.
