The common Hebrew term for street (<em>chuts</em>) basically means &#x201C;outside.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 42:2</a>, ftn) In ancient towns and cities of Bible lands it appears that most streets were unpaved. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 18:42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 10:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> La 2:21</a>) However, channels for water drainage from the streets have been discovered in Jericho and Gezer.Generally, streets were narrow and winding. But there were also &#x201C;broad ways.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 14:21</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Re 21:21</a>.) Nineveh&#x2019;s streets were wide enough to accommodate chariots. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Na 2:4</a>) Babylon and Damascus had broad avenues or processional ways, and some streets bore names. During the Roman period, &#x201C;the street called Straight&#x201D; in Damascus was a three-lane thoroughfare about 30&#xA0;m (100&#xA0;ft) wide.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 9:11</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/0\">STRAIGHT</a>.An open area, the public square, likely near a city gate, might serve as a place to transact business or meet for instruction.

They were places of commercial enterprise, shops of a certain kind sometimes being grouped together, as on &#x201C;the street of the bakers&#x201D; in Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 37:21</a>) The &#x201C;streets&#x201D; that Ben-hadad offered to be assigned to Ahab in Damascus were evidently for the establishment of bazaars, or markets, to promote Ahab&#x2019;s commercial interests in that Syrian capital. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 20:34</a>) At night the streets of some cities apparently were under the vigilant eyes of watchmen.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004246/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 3:1-3</a>.The streets also were places where news was announced.
