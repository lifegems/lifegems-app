(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004257/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:30</a>) Some scholars suggest that the name &#x201C;Succoth-benoth&#x201D; is a Hebraized form of Sarpanitu, the consort of Merodach (Marduk). Others favor an identification with Merodach, or Marduk, on the basis that the name &#x201C;Succoth-benoth&#x201D; may be <em>Sakut</em>(<em>h</em>)<em>ban&#x2BC;wat</em>(<em>h</em>)<em>, </em>meaning &#x201C;the Counselor, Creator of the Land.&#x201D; This title is understood to apply to Merodach, who was viewed by the Babylonians as the creator of the world."}
