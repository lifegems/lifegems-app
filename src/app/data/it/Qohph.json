In translating Hebrew names where it occurs, <em>qohph </em>is usually represented in English by &#x201C;c&#x201D; or &#x201C;k,&#x201D; as in &#x201C;Cainan&#x201D; and &#x201C;Kish.&#x201D; The sound is stronger than that of the letter <em>kaph </em>[&#x5DB;] and is pronounced farther back in the throat, as a strong English &#x201C;q&#x201D; formed at the back of the palate. In the Hebrew, it is the initial letter in each of the eight verses in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003597/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 119:145-152</a>."}
