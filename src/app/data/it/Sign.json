The sign (Heb., <em>&#x2BC;ohth; </em>Gr., <em>se&#xB7;mei&#x2B9;on</em>) might be an evidence of authenticity or of authority, a warning of danger, or an indicator as to the wise course to follow.Among the many signs that Jehovah has provided for human guidance, the first mentioned as such are the heavenly luminaries, the sun and the moon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:14</a>) They are time indicators as well as visible signs of God&#x2019;s existence and qualities.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 2:23</a>) But the signs did not produce faith in hardhearted ones.

When on two occasions religious leaders asked Jesus to display to them a sign from heaven, they likely were demanding that he perform, as proof that he was the Messiah, the sign foretold at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>, namely, the &#x201C;son of man&#x201D; appearing with the clouds of the heavens to take his Kingdom power. But it was not God&#x2019;s time for that prophecy to be fulfilled, and Christ would not perform a showy display merely to gratify their selfish demand. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:1</a>) Rather, he told them that the only sign that would be given them was &#x201C;the sign of Jonah the prophet.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:39-41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:4</a>) After about three days in the belly of a huge fish, Jonah had gone and preached to Nineveh. Jonah thereby became a &#x201C;sign&#x201D; to the capital of Assyria. Jesus&#x2019; generation had &#x201C;the sign of Jonah&#x201D; when Christ spent parts of three days in the grave and was resurrected after which his disciples proclaimed the evidence of that event. In this, Christ was a sign to that generation, but even that did not convince most of the Jews.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 11:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 1:22</a>.<strong>Sign of Christ&#x2019;s Presence. </strong>Shortly before Jesus&#x2019; death his apostles asked him: &#x201C;What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 13:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 21:7</a>) There were distinct differences between this question and the requests for a sign that the religious leaders had made. While right there, able to see him and his works, those leaders would not accept him as Messiah and King-Designate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:15</a>) Once they asked for a sign &#x201C;to tempt him&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 11:16</a>); also some may have been infected with idle curiosity about Jesus&#x2019; signs, as was Herod. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 23:8</a>) Quite the opposite, the disciples who asked about the sign of Christ&#x2019;s presence already accepted him as Messiah and King. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 16:16</a>) But Jesus had said that the Kingdom was &#x201C;not coming with striking observableness.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 17:20</a>) Consequently (though the apostles mistakenly believed that the Kingdom would be established on earth; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:6</a>), at the arrival of the Kingdom they did not want to be like the Jewish leaders<wbr>&#x2014;blind to Jesus&#x2019; presence. Accordingly, they asked, not for a miraculous sign to be performed right there, but what the future identifying sign would be.In response Jesus described a composite &#x201C;sign,&#x201D; one made up of many evidences, including wars, earthquakes, persecution of Christians, and a preaching about the Kingdom. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:4-14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> 32,&#xA0;33</a>) The destruction of Jerusalem and its temple was under consideration when the disciples asked Jesus for the &#x201C;sign&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 21:5-7</a>), and his reply gave prophecies that applied to Jerusalem and Judea, which were fulfilled during their lifetime.

Jesus applied the expression &#x201C;Son of man&#x201D; and the prophecy at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Daniel 7:13, 14</a> to himself.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:63, 64;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/35/1\" data-bid=\"36-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 14:61,&#xA0;62</a>.About 96&#xA0;C.E., 26 years after the destruction of Jerusalem, John wrote about things that would take place in the future, and he saw in vision Jesus Christ &#x201C;coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, and those who pierced him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Re 1:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004114/36/1\" data-bid=\"37-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;7</a>) Hence, both this statement about something that was to take place after 96&#xA0;C.E. and what Christ said about &#x201C;the sign of the Son of man&#x201D; referred to Jesus as coming in the clouds and as being seen by all people.
