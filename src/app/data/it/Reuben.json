His mother was Jacob&#x2019;s less favored wife, Leah, who named her boy Reuben, &#x201C;because,&#x201D; to quote her, &#x201C;Jehovah has looked upon my wretchedness, in that now my husband will begin to love me.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 29:30-32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 35:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 46:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Ex 1:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 2:1</a>) As a result of Jehovah&#x2019;s continued favor on his mother, Reuben and his five full brothers (Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun) constituted half of the original tribal heads of Israel; the other six (Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher) were Reuben&#x2019;s half brothers.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 35:23-26</a>.Some of Reuben&#x2019;s good qualities displayed themselves when he persuaded his nine brothers to throw Joseph into a dry well instead of killing him, Reuben intending to return secretly and deliver Joseph out of the well. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 37:18-30</a>) More than 20 years later when these same brothers reasoned that the spy charges against them down in Egypt were due to their mistreatment of Joseph, Reuben reminded the others that he had not shared in their plot on Joseph&#x2019;s life. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 42:9-14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 21,&#xA0;22</a>) Again, when Jacob refused to let Benjamin accompany his brothers on their second trip to Egypt, it was Reuben who offered his own two sons as surety, saying: &#x201C;You may put [them] to death if I do not bring [Benjamin] back to you.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 42:37</a>.As the firstborn son of Jacob, Reuben naturally had the rights of the firstborn son of the family. As such, he was entitled to two portions in the estate that his father Jacob left behind. At the time just before Jacob&#x2019;s death, when he blessed his sons, the question was, Would Reuben come into these rights of the firstborn? Also, the patriarch Jacob, as head of the family, had acted as Jehovah&#x2019;s priest for the whole family and had offered up sacrifices at the family altar and had led in prayer and in giving religious instruction. As father, he had also acted as the governor of the whole family and of all its servants, its livestock, and its properties. Would these responsibilities devolve upon Reuben?Jacob dealt with Reuben first, saying: &#x201C;Reuben, you are my firstborn, my vigor and the beginning of my generative power, the excellence of dignity and the excellence of strength. With reckless license like waters, do not you excel, because you have gone up to your father&#x2019;s bed. At that time you profaned my lounge. He went up to it!&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:3,&#xA0;4</a>.Jacob recalled a disqualification for Reuben that affected his future privileges. Reuben had disgraced his father. He had committed incestuous immorality with his father&#x2019;s concubine, Bilhah, the maidservant of Jacob&#x2019;s beloved wife Rachel. This was shortly after Rachel died following her giving birth to Benjamin. The Bible record does not explain whether firstborn Reuben violated the maidservant Bilhah to prevent her from taking Rachel&#x2019;s place in Jacob&#x2019;s affection, thus becoming more favored than Reuben&#x2019;s mother Leah, or whether Reuben acted out of sheer lust for Bilhah. It simply says: &#x201C;And it came about while Israel was tabernacling in that land that once Reuben went and lay down with Bilhah his father&#x2019;s concubine, and Israel got to hear of it.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 35:22</a>) The Greek <em>Septuagint </em>adds: &#x201C;And it appeared evil in his sight.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 35:21</a>, <em>LXX</em><em>, </em>Thomson.Reuben was not disowned and cast out for this. It was years later, when he blessed his sons, that Jacob said to Reuben, by divine inspiration: &#x201C;Do not you excel.&#x201D; Thus Reuben was stripped of privileges that would otherwise have been his as a firstborn son. This was because he acted with &#x201C;reckless license like waters.&#x201D; He proved himself either unstable like waters or turbulent and headlong like waters bursting a dam or raging down a torrent valley. Reuben should have exercised self-control. He should have shown a son&#x2019;s respect for his father&#x2019;s dignity and for the honor of the two sons of Bilhah, his father&#x2019;s concubine.<strong>2. </strong>The name Reuben also stands for the tribe made up of Reuben&#x2019;s descendants as well as for the land of their inheritance. Reuben&#x2019;s tribe stemmed from his four sons, Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi, the family heads of the Reubenites.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 46:8,&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Ex 6:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 5:3</a>.A year after the Exodus from Egypt, Elizur, the son of Shedeur, was selected as chieftain to represent the entire tribe of Reuben.

A census taken in the second year of the wilderness experience <span id=\"page796\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"796\" data-before-text=\"796\"></span>enumerated 46,500 Reubenites fit for military service, 20 years old and upward. About 39 years later this force, now 43,730, was somewhat less.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 1:2, 3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 20, 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 26:5-7</a>.In the camp of Israel the Reubenites, flanked by the descendants of Simeon and Gad, were situated on the S side of the tabernacle. When on the march this three-tribe division headed by Reuben followed the three-tribe division of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.

The land had been acquired through the victory over the two kings Sihon and Og. They reasoned that it was ideal for them because they had large flocks and herds. Moses granted this request to them (and half the tribe of Manasseh) on one condition, that the fighting forces of these tribes also cross over the Jordan and assist the other tribes in the conquest of Canaan, a condition that the two and a half tribes willingly met.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 32:1-38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Jos 1:12-18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/15/2\" data-bid=\"16-3\" class=\"b\"> 4:12, 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/15/3\" data-bid=\"16-4\" class=\"b\"> 12:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/15/4\" data-bid=\"16-5\" class=\"b\"> 13:8-10</a>.Reuben&#x2019;s territorial inheritance was thus settled even before the Israelites crossed the Jordan, Moses himself giving the southern portion of Sihon&#x2019;s conquered kingdom to this tribe. It extended from the torrent valley of Arnon, a natural boundary that separated this territory from Moab on the S, to just N of the Dead Sea; the land N of Reuben was given to the Gadites.

But when it was explained that the altar was not for sacrifices, but was for a witness of faithfulness between the tribes on both sides of the Jordan, the altar was given a name, likely &#x201C;Witness,&#x201D; for, as they said, &#x201C;It is a witness between us that Jehovah is the true God.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003713/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 22:9-34</a>.<strong>Later History. </strong>Many years later, when Barak and Deborah sang a great victory song, they recalled that the Reubenites had failed to join them in the battle against Sisera.
