Ephraim, the younger brother of Manasseh, was born in Egypt before the seven-year famine began. The name Ephraim was given to him by his father &#x201C;because, to quote [Joseph], &#x2018;God has made me fruitful in the land of my wretchedness.&#x2019;&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 41:50-52</a>.On his deathbed, Jacob, in effect, adopted his grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh and appointed them to be the equals of his direct sons.

Ezer and Elead, who were likely sons of Ephraim, were slain by the men of Gath. Sometime after the death of these sons, Ephraim fathered Beriah.<strong>2. </strong>The name Ephraim is also applied to the tribe that descended from him. About a year after the Exodus from Egypt, Ephraim&#x2019;s 40,500 fighting men from 20 years old upward outnumbered Manasseh&#x2019;s able-bodied men by 8,300.

Moses, when blessing the Israelites, prophetically spoke of &#x201C;the tens of thousands of Ephraim,&#x201D; but of &#x201C;the thousands of Manasseh.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">De 33:17</a>.In the wilderness, the Ephraimites, with Elishama serving as chieftain, were assigned to camp on the W side of the tabernacle, along with the tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin.

The tribe also had enclave cities in Manasseh&#x2019;s territory. On the N, Ephraim was bounded by Manasseh, and on the S, by Benjamin and Dan.

At Shechem, Moses&#x2019; successor, the Ephraimite Joshua, congregated the tribes of Israel and appealed to them to serve Jehovah faithfully. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 24:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> 14,&#xA0;15</a>) Also, here at Shechem, Joseph&#x2019;s bones were finally buried, and both Joshua and Aaron&#x2019;s son Eleazar were buried in the mountainous region of Ephraim. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 24:29-33</a>) Later, Benjamite Judge Ehud assembled the Israelites in the mountainous region of Ephraim to fight against the Moabites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 3:26-30</a>) After Ehud&#x2019;s death the prophetess Deborah, from her residence in the mountainous region of Ephraim, sent for Barak as the one designated by Jehovah to deliver Israel from the oppression of King Jabin. In the victory song of Barak and Deborah, Ephraim is the first tribe to be mentioned. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:1-7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 5:14</a>) At a later time, Tola of the tribe of Issachar judged Israel for 23 years while dwelling at Shamir in the mountainous region of Ephraim. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 10:1,&#xA0;2</a>) The prophet Samuel of the tribe of Levi was born at Ramah in the mountainous region of Ephraim, and it was there that he, as an adult, established his home.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 1:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/21/1\" data-bid=\"22-2\" class=\"b\"> 19, 20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/21/2\" data-bid=\"22-3\" class=\"b\"> 7:15-17</a>.Pride and an extreme desire for prominence caused severe difficulty to the Ephraimites in their relationship to the other tribes. As early as the time of the judges this trait manifested itself. For example, the Ephraimites tried to pick a quarrel with Gideon for not having called them earlier in the fight against Midian. However, Gideon&#x2019;s tactfulness on that occasion averted a clash. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 8:1-3</a>) Later, although having previously turned down an opportunity to assist Jephthah, the Ephraimites felt slighted when he did not call them to fight against the Ammonites. They warred with Jephthah and experienced a humiliating defeat; thousands were killed at the fords of the Jordan, where they were identified as Ephraimites because of their pronunciation of the password &#x201C;Shibboleth&#x201D; as &#x201C;Sibboleth.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 12:1-6</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 25:10</a>.After the death of King Saul, among those who came to Hebron to turn the kingship over to David there were 20,800 men of Ephraim.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 12:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;30</a>.<strong>Dominant Tribe of the Northern Kingdom. </strong>From the time the kingdom was divided during the reign of Rehoboam, Ephraim, as the most prominent and influential tribe of the northern kingdom, made a bad name for itself. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 13:1</a>) The first king, the Ephraimite Jeroboam, established calf worship at Dan and Bethel.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 25:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/28/1\" data-bid=\"29-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 7:15</a>) Therefore the prophets Hosea and Isaiah directed their strong denunciations against Ephraim. Hosea condemned Ephraim for mingling with the nations, learning their works, and serving their idols. He compared Ephraim to a round cake not turned over, baked or even burned on the bottom but not done on the top. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 7:8</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 106:35, 36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/30/1\" data-bid=\"31-2\" class=\"b\"> Ho 4:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/30/2\" data-bid=\"31-3\" class=\"b\"> 12:14</a>.) Although having been sapped of strength by strangers, Ephraim, rather than returning to Jehovah, appealed to Egypt for help and made a covenant with Assyria. Thus Ephraim was like a simpleminded dove that would not escape being trapped in a net.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 7:9-12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/31/1\" data-bid=\"32-2\" class=\"b\"> 8:9</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/32/1\" data-bid=\"33-2\" class=\"b\"> Ho 12:1</a>.The prophet Isaiah addressed himself to the &#x2018;proud drunkards of Ephraim.&#x2019; Their independence from the kingdom of Judah and their alliances with Syria and other nations had affected them like intoxicating liquor.

During the reign of Judah&#x2019;s King Asa, for example, many Ephraimites deserted to him when they saw that Jehovah was with him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 15:9</a>) Later, Ephraimites were also present in Jerusalem for the Passover celebration in the first year of Hezekiah&#x2019;s reign and afterward shared in destroying appendages of idolatry.

Pride kept these from humbling themselves and coming down to Jerusalem for the Passover.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 30:10,&#xA0;11</a>.<strong>3. </strong>A city generally considered to be the same as the Ephrain captured by Abijah the king of <span id=\"page755\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"755\" data-before-text=\"755\"></span>Judah from Jeroboam the king of Israel.
