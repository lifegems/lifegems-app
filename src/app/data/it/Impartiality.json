Impartiality is a matter of not letting position, ability to speak well, wealth, a bribe, or, on the other hand, sentimentality for a poor or otherwise disadvantaged person sway one&#x2019;s judgment or actions in favor of the individual. Impartiality sees that all are treated in harmony with what is fair and just, according to what each deserves and needs.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 3:27</a>.The Hebrew expression <em>na&#xB7;sa&#x2BC;&#x2B9; pa&#xB7;nim&#x2B9;, </em>rendered &#x2018;treat with partiality,&#x2019; literally means &#x201C;lift up the face.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Le 19:15</a>) An Oriental way of greeting was to bow humbly and turn one&#x2019;s face to the ground. As a sign of acknowledgment and recognition, the one greeted lifted up, or raised, the face of the one who had bowed.

The Hebrew phrase <em>na&#xB7;khar&#x2B9; pa&#xB7;nim&#x2B9; </em>(rendered &#x201C;be partial,&#x201D; but literally meaning &#x201C;recognize the face&#x201D;) was similarly used.

However, an honest examination of his dealings with Israel will reveal that such a charge is erroneous. Jehovah chose and dealt with Israel, not <span id=\"page1193\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1193\" data-before-text=\"1193\"></span>because of their greatness and numbers, but because of his love and appreciation for the faith and loyalty of his friend Abraham, their forefather.

When Israel was disobedient, God was patient and merciful, but he punished them, nevertheless. And though their position was a favored one, they were under weightier responsibility before God because of bearing God&#x2019;s name and because they were under the Law. For the Law carried curses against the one breaking it. It is written: &#x201C;Cursed is the one who will not put the words of this law in force by doing them.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">De 27:26</a>) The Jews, by violating the Law, came under this curse, which was in addition to their condemnation as offspring of sinful Adam. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:12</a>) Therefore, to redeem the Jews from this special disability, Christ not only had to die but also had to die on a torture stake, as the apostle Paul argues at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Galatians 3:10-13</a>.Thus, God exercised no partiality toward Israel.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 3:14</a>) By this means God was actually working toward the benefit of people of all nations in his due time. In harmony with this, the apostle remarks: &#x201C;Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of people of the nations? Yes, of people of the nations also, if truly God is one, who will declare circumcised people righteous as a result of faith and uncircumcised people righteous by means of their faith.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 3:29,&#xA0;30</a>) Furthermore, in the ancient Jewish commonwealth, men from other nations could come under God&#x2019;s favor and blessing by worshiping Jehovah the God of Israel and keeping his law, as did the Gibeonites, the Nethinim (meaning &#x201C;Given Ones&#x201D;), and many alien residents.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 9:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/21/1\" data-bid=\"22-2\" class=\"b\"> 27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/21/2\" data-bid=\"22-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 8:41-43;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/21/3\" data-bid=\"22-4\" class=\"b\"> Ezr 8:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/21/4\" data-bid=\"22-5\" class=\"b\"> Nu 9:14</a>.Although patient and merciful, repeatedly receiving Israel back when they repented, Jehovah finally cast them off as his name people.

How finely he worked out matters so that all mankind would have opportunity to receive his favor and life!<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 55:8-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 11:33</a>.<strong><em>Not partial toward David. </em></strong>As Jehovah told Moses, he is a God who will by no means give exemption from punishment for wrongdoing.

He punished David severely for his sins. After David&#x2019;s sin against God in the affair involving Bath-sheba and her husband Uriah, Jehovah told him: &#x201C;Here I am raising up against you calamity out of your own house; and I will take your wives under your own eyes and give them to your fellowman, and he will certainly lie down with your wives under the eyes of this sun. Whereas you yourself acted in secret, I, for my part, shall do this thing in front of all Israel and in front of the sun.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 12:11,&#xA0;12</a>.The Bible account reveals that David indeed suffered much trouble from his own family.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 3:25,&#xA0;26</a>) Through the sacrifice of his Son, God has a just and impartial basis on which to undo the death of Uriah and others, so that, ultimately, none suffer unjustly.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 17:31</a>.<strong>Counsel to Judges. </strong>Jehovah gave strong counsel to the judges in Israel as to impartiality.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 5:17</a>) This is, not because of the personalities of these men or their ability, but because of their diligence and hard work at the extra responsibilities placed upon them.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 3:1</a>) Therefore they deserve to be heard, obeyed, and given honor.

This is not because of the personal qualities of these men, some of whom may be corrupt, nor is it because they may be in position to grant special favors. Christians respect rulers because God commands it; also because of the position of responsibility the office stands for. The apostle says: &#x201C;Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God. Therefore he who opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002160/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 13:1,&#xA0;2</a>) These men, if they misuse their authority, must answer to God.
