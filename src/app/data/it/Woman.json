The Hebrew expression for woman is <em>&#x2BC;ish&#xB7;shah&#x2B9; </em>(literally, a female man), which is also rendered &#x201C;wife.&#x201D; Similarly, the Greek term <em>gy&#xB7;ne&#x2B9; </em>is translated both &#x201C;woman&#x201D; and &#x201C;wife.&#x201D;<strong>Creation. </strong>Before the man Adam ever asked for a human companion, God his Creator made provision. After placing Adam in the garden of Eden and giving him the law respecting the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, Jehovah said: &#x201C;It is not good for the man to continue by himself. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:18</a>) He did not oblige the man to go seeking a companion among the animals, but he brought the animals to Adam for naming. Adam was not inclined toward bestiality and was able to determine that there was no suitable companion for him among these. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:19,&#xA0;20</a>) &#x201C;Hence Jehovah God had a deep sleep fall upon the man and, while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. And Jehovah God proceeded to build the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and to bring her to the man. Then the man said: &#x2018;This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, because from man this one was taken.&#x2019;&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:21-23</a>.<strong>Position and Responsibilities. </strong>The woman, being created out of the man, was dependent upon the man for being brought into existence. Being part of the man, &#x201C;one flesh&#x201D; with him, and a complement and helper to him, she was subject to him as her head. She was also under the law that God had given Adam about the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. She was responsible to work for the good of the man. Together they were to have children and to exercise dominion over the animals.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:24</a>.Since the normal course for women in Bible <span id=\"page1196\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1196\" data-before-text=\"1196\"></span>times was to marry, the scriptures that treat of the woman&#x2019;s responsibilities usually have reference to her position as a wife. The primary duty of all women in Israel was to serve Jehovah God in true worship. Abigail, who became the wife of David after her good-for-nothing husband Nabal died, was an example of this. Even though Nabal took a bad course, refusing to use his material goods to help David, the anointed of Jehovah, Abigail realized that she, as Nabal&#x2019;s wife, was not obligated to follow her husband in such action contrary to Jehovah&#x2019;s will. Jehovah blessed her when her assisting his anointed one showed her persistence in right worship.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:23-31,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 39-42</a>.Secondarily, the woman was to obey her husband.

Since her seed was to crush the serpent&#x2019;s head, he would have to be more than a human seed, for the Scriptures show that it was not to a literal snake on the ground that God&#x2019;s words were aimed.

Consequently, the &#x201C;woman&#x201D; of the prophecy could not be a human woman, such as Mary the mother of Jesus.

Abraham&#x2019;s wife Sarah, Paul says, corresponds to &#x201C;the Jerusalem above,&#x201D; who is the spiritual mother of Paul and his spirit-begotten associates.

It would be a composite body of persons, an organization, a heavenly one.This &#x201C;woman&#x201D; is described in John&#x2019;s vision, in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/69/0\" data-bid=\"70-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation chapter&#xA0;12</a>.

This vision was given to John long after Jesus&#x2019; human birth and also after his anointing as God&#x2019;s Messiah. Since it obviously has to do with the same person, it must have reference, not to Jesus&#x2019; human birth, but to some other event, namely, his being installed in Kingdom power. So the birth of God&#x2019;s Messianic Kingdom was here pictured.Satan is shown later as persecuting the &#x201C;woman&#x201D; and making war with &#x201C;the remaining ones of her seed.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/71/0\" data-bid=\"72-1\" class=\"b\">Re 12:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/71/1\" data-bid=\"72-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;17</a>) The &#x201C;woman&#x201D; being heavenly, and Satan by this time being hurled down to the earth (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/72/0\" data-bid=\"73-1\" class=\"b\">Re 12:7-9</a>), he could not reach those heavenly persons of whom the &#x201C;woman&#x201D; was made up, but he could reach the remaining ones of her &#x201C;seed,&#x201D; her children, the brothers of Jesus Christ still on earth.

So he was telling Israel of the inroads such conditions would make on the manpower of the nation, creating such a shortage that several women would attach themselves to one man. They would be glad to take his name and have some male attentions, even if they had to share him with other women. They would accept polygamy or concubinage to have some little part in a man&#x2019;s life. Thereby some of the reproach of widowhood or of the unmarried state, and childlessness, would be removed.In a prophecy comforting Israel, Jehovah said: &#x201C;How long will you turn this way and that, O&#xA0;unfaithful daughter? For Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth: A mere female will press around an able-bodied man.&#x201D; (&#x201C;The woman woos the man!&#x201D; <em>AT</em>) (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004621/76/0\" data-bid=\"77-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 31:22</a>) Up until then Israel, with whom God was in the relationship of marriage by reason of the Law covenant, was turning &#x201C;this way and that&#x201D; in unfaithfulness.
