King Josiah, in 642&#xA0;B.C.E., sent Shaphan and two other officials to High Priest Hilkiah with instructions for temple repairs. On this occasion Hilkiah turned over to Shaphan &#x201C;the very book of the law,&#x201D; likely even the original, that had recently been found in the temple. No sooner had Shaphan read a portion of the Law to Josiah than he and his son Ahikam, along with others, were dispatched by Josiah as a delegation to inquire concerning Jehovah&#x2019;s purpose for Judah. They went to the prophetess Huldah and reported back to the king Jehovah&#x2019;s prophecy that destruction would come, but not during Josiah&#x2019;s reign.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003949/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 22:3-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003949/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 34:8-28</a>.Shaphan&#x2019;s sons Ahikam (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003949/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 26:24</a>), Elasah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003949/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 29:1-3</a>), and Gemariah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003949/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 36:10-12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003949/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;25</a>) apparently were also adherents to true worship.
