The Hebrew word <em>cha&#xB7;rash&#x2B9; </em>is most frequently translated by the general term &#x201C;craftsman,&#x201D; but when it occurs along with some particular material, the phrase is rendered more specifically, for example, &#x201C;wood-and-metal worker&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001059/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 27:15</a>), &#x201C;workers in wood and workers in stone&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001059/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 5:11</a>), &#x201C;carver of iron,&#x201D; &#x201C;wood carver&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001059/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 44:12,&#xA0;13</a>), also as &#x201C;smith&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001059/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 13:19</a>), and &#x201C;manufacturers.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001059/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 45:16</a>) Further illustrating the many specialties that come under the designation &#x201C;craftsmanship&#x201D; is the description of Bezalel who, along with Oholiab, was a worker with metals, precious stones, and wood and was a weaver and dyer, skilled &#x201C;in every sort of craftsmanship.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001059/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 35:30-35</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001059/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 12:11,&#xA0;12</a>.Many crafts, such as toolmaking, carpentry, brickmaking, spinning, weaving, textile finishing, and making pottery and jewelry, were at one time simple household duties performed by ordinary men or women. Settled communal living, however, brought about specialization. Even before the Flood certain men were known as specialized craftsmen. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001059/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 4:21,&#xA0;22</a>) Nebuchadnezzar took the craftsmen along with the princes and military engineers from Jerusalem captive to Babylon in 617&#xA0;B.C.E.
