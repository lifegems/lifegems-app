(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000684/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 1:11</a>) The prophet repeatedly makes a play on words in the use of the names of several towns in this portion of the prophecy, so that in reality he says: &#x201C;In the house of Aphrah [probably meaning &#x201C;Dust&#x201D;] wallow in the very dust. Make your way across, O&#xA0;inhabitress of Shaphir [meaning &#x201C;Elegant; Polished; Agreeable&#x201D;], in shameful nudity. The inhabitress of Zaanan has not gone forth. The wailing of Beth-ezel [meaning &#x201C;House Nearby (Alongside)&#x201D;] will take from you people its standing place. For the inhabitress of Maroth [from a root meaning &#x201C;be bitter&#x201D;] has waited for good, but what is bad has come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000684/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 1:10-12</a>) The prophet&#x2019;s warning, directed to those due to experience the disaster, thus in effect tells them that the wailing will spread to as far as Jerusalem.Though the identification is only tentative, Beth-ezel has been located at the site of present-day Deir el-&#x2BD;Asal, about 16&#xA0;km (10&#xA0;mi) WSW of Hebron."}
