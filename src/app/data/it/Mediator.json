Accordingly, the text has been rendered in the following ways: &#x201C;For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.&#x201D; (<em>KJ</em>) &#x201C;For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.&#x201D; (<em>RS</em>) &#x201C;For where a covenant is it is necessary for the death to be brought in of him that hath covenanted.&#x201D; (<em>Ro</em>) &#x201C;For where there is a covenant, the death of the human covenanter needs to be furnished.&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>) &#x201C;For where a covenant is, the death of the covenant-victim to come in is necessary.&#x201D; (<em>Yg</em>) &#x201C;For <span id=\"page361\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"361\" data-before-text=\"361\"></span>where a Covenant exists, the Death of that which has ratified it is necessary to be produced.&#x201D; (<em>ED</em>) &#x201C;For where a covenant is, there is a necessity for the death of that which establisheth the covenant.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The New Testament in an Improved Version.</em>The literal rendering as set forth in interlinear translations of the Greek text is as follows: &#x201C;Where for covenant, death necessity to be borne of the one having made for self covenant.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 9:16</a>, <em>Int</em>) &#x201C;For where there is a covenant, the death there is necessity to be offered of the one making covenant.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Interlinear Greek-English New Testament, </em>translated by Alfred Marshall.The rendering of <em>di&#xB7;a&#xB7;the&#x2B9;ke </em>as &#x201C;covenant&#x201D; expresses correctly the writer&#x2019;s meaning. The renderings &#x201C;testament&#x201D; and &#x201C;will,&#x201D; found in many versions, are inconsistent with the use of the term in the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>as well as in many places in the Christian Greek Scriptures.

And it may be noted that, particularly with the Hebrews, approaches to God and covenants with God were regularly based on sacrifices, the victims sacrificed sometimes being cut in pieces on the occasion of entering a covenant. It is quite obvious that the Law covenant and the new covenant required the shedding of blood in order to go into operation or to be effective before God. Otherwise God would not have recognized them as valid, nor dealt with the persons involved on the basis of a covenant relationship.

They needed a mediator. Their weakness was demonstrated in their request to Moses: &#x201C;You speak with us, and let us listen; but let not God speak with us for fear we may die.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 20:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 12:18-20</a>) Accordingly, Jehovah mercifully constituted Moses mediator of the Law covenant and arranged for animals to be sacrificed to validate the covenant. Moses, of course, was also imperfect and sinful; however, he enjoyed a favorable standing with God, even as Abraham had earlier. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 11:23-28</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/0\">DECLARE RIGHTEOUS</a> [How &#x201C;counted&#x201D; righteous].) On the occasion of the inauguration of the covenant, Moses officiated, directing the sacrifice of the animals. Then he sprinkled their blood on the scroll or &#x201C;the book of the covenant.&#x201D; He read the book to the people, setting forth the terms, and the people responded by agreeing to obey. Moses then sprinkled them (doubtless the representative older men) with the blood, saying: &#x201C;Here is the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has concluded with you as respects all these words.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 24:3-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 9:18-22</a>.<strong><em>Inauguration of the priesthood. </em></strong>The designated priests of the house of Aaron could not begin functioning as priests on their own. They had to be installed in office under the direction of God&#x2019;s mediator Moses. When this took place, Nisan 1-7, 1512&#xA0;B.C.E., Moses anointed the tabernacle and its furniture and utensils and also anointed Aaron with the oil of special composition. After filling the hands of Aaron and his sons with sacrificial materials, Moses waved their filled hands before Jehovah, thereby consecrating them or &#x2018;filling their hands with power&#x2019; for the priesthood. Afterward he spattered them with the anointing oil and blood from the altar. So one function of Moses&#x2019; mediatorial office was the installing and setting in operation of the priesthood, which was a feature of the Law covenant.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Le&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 7:11</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/1\">INSTALLATION</a>.Moses also played a significant part in connection with the first services performed by the newly installed priesthood, Nisan 8, 1512&#xA0;B.C.E., as he directed the procedure and, along with Aaron, blessed the people.

Christians are also sinners. Since the blood of animals cannot actually remove sins (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:4</a>), a better sacrifice is necessary.

After mentioning the sacrifices offered under the Law, he says: &#x201C;How much more will the blood of the Christ .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. cleanse our consciences from dead works that we may render sacred service to the living God? So that is why he is a mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has occurred for their release by ransom from the transgressions under the former covenant, the ones who have been called might receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance. For where there is a covenant, the death of the human covenanter needs to be furnished. For a covenant is valid over dead victims, since it is not in force at any time while the human covenanter is living.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 9:11-17</a>.Paul goes on to point out that the former covenant was not inaugurated without blood.

This sacrifice is not only for those for whom Jesus mediates the new covenant but also for all mankind expressing faith in Christ. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 2:2</a>) These not in the new covenant also appreciate that &#x201C;there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 4:12</a>) They, too, look to Jesus Christ as their great heavenly High Priest, through whom they can approach God and through whose ministration they can get forgiveness of sin. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 4:14-16</a>) <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002957/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 21:22-24</a> points out that &#x2018;the nations will walk in the light of New Jerusalem,&#x2019; where Jehovah God is the light and the Lamb Jesus Christ is the lamp."}
