The principal part of the Roman military establishment was the legion<em>. </em>It was a large independent unit, a complete army in itself, rather than a specialized portion of a greater force. Sometimes legions fought together, merging their resources and strength under a central command, as when four legions combined under Titus for the siege of Jerusalem, 70&#xA0;C.E. But usually the legion stood alone with its individual commission of duty. Supplementing the legionnaires were noncitizens from all parts of the empire who made up the <em>auxilia, </em>often volunteers from the local district. Auxiliaries, backed up by the legions, were stationed along the borders. Upon honorable discharge one in the <em>auxilia </em>was granted Roman citizenship.The number of legions varied at different times, from 25 or less to as many as&#xA0;33. Likewise the number of soldiers comprising the legion fluctuated from about 4,000 to 6,000; in the first century the force usually numbered 6,000. For this reason &#x201C;legion&#x201D; as used in the Scriptures apparently means an indefinite, large number.

When Herod Agrippa died, 44&#xA0;C.E., there were five cohorts in Caesarea. Further subdivided, the legion had 60 centuries, usually 100 men each, under the leadership of a centurion (army officer, <em>NW</em>). These officers were especially valuable, having the responsibility of training soldiers.

Says Justin Martyr, of the second century C.E., in his &#x201C;Dialogue With Trypho, a Jew&#x201D; (CX): &#x201C;We who were filled with war, and mutual slaughter, and every wickedness, have each through the whole earth changed our warlike weapons,<wbr>&#x2014;our swords into ploughshares, and our spears into implements of tillage.&#x201D; (<em>The Ante-Nicene Fathers, </em>Vol.&#xA0;I, p.&#xA0;254) In his treatise &#x201C;The Chaplet, or De Corona&#x201D; (XI), when discussing &#x201C;whether warfare is proper at all for Christians,&#x201D; Tertullian (c.&#xA0;200&#xA0;C.E.) argued from Scripture the unlawfulness even of a military life itself, concluding, &#x201C;I banish from us the military life.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Ante-Nicene Fathers, </em>1957, Vol.&#xA0;III, pp.&#xA0;99, 100.&#x201C;A careful review of all the information available goes to show that, until the time of Marcus Aurelius [121-180&#xA0;C.E.], no Christian became a soldier; and no soldier, after becoming a Christian, remained in military service.&#x201D; (<em>The Rise of Christianity, </em>by E.&#xA0;W.&#xA0;Barnes, 1947, p.&#xA0;333) &#x201C;It will be seen presently that the evidence for the existence of a single Christian soldier between 60 and about 165&#xA0;A.D. is exceedingly slight; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. up to the reign of Marcus Aurelius at least, no Christian would become a soldier after his baptism.&#x201D; (<em>The Early Church and the World, </em>by C.&#xA0;J.&#xA0;Cadoux, 1955, pp.&#xA0;275, 276) &#x201C;In the second century, Christianity .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. had affirmed the incompatibility of military service with Christianity.&#x201D; (<em>A Short History of Rome, </em>by G.&#xA0;Ferrero and C.&#xA0;Barbagallo, 1919, p.&#xA0;382) &#x201C;The behavior of the Christians was very different from that of the Romans. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.
