If he was an official over Moab, as his name might imply, it was probably during the time when Moab was under Judah&#x2019;s domination. His holding such a position remains uncertain, however, as nothing is said of him personally in the Scripture record.Pahath-moab&#x2019;s descendants noted in Ezra and Nehemiah are all postexilic. Some of them comprised the second most numerous family to return with Zerubbabel in 537&#xA0;B.C.E.
