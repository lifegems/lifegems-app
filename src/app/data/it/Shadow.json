It may afford welcome protection from the hot sun. Therefore, one is figuratively said to come under the &#x201C;shadow&#x201D; of that which serves as or is looked to for protection, covering, security, or refuge. Thus, with reference to the strangers he had taken into his home, Lot said to the men of Sodom: &#x201C;Only to these men do not do a thing, because that is why they have come under the shadow of my roof.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003926/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 19:8</a>) And Jehovah, by means of his prophet Isaiah, pronounced woe upon those taking refuge in &#x201C;the shadow of Egypt,&#x201D; that is, looking to Egypt for protection.

Yet it can give an idea of the general shape or design of the reality that casts it. In this connection Paul explained that the Law, including its festivals, tabernacle, and sacrifices, had a shadow that represented greater things to come. He wrote: &#x201C;The reality belongs to the Christ.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003926/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Col 2:16, 17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003926/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 8:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003926/14/2\" data-bid=\"15-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:23-28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003926/14/3\" data-bid=\"15-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:1</a>.Regarding the miraculous reversing of the shadow mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003926/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Kings 20:9-11</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003926/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 38:8</a>, see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003926/0\">SUN</a>."}
