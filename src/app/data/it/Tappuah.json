(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004321/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 2:42,&#xA0;43</a>) Some suggest that his name is to be connected with Beth-tappuah, a town near Hebron.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004321/0\">BETH-TAPPUAH</a>.<strong>2. </strong>A town in the Shephelah region assigned to the tribe of Judah.

Horvat Bet Natif within the abandoned village of Beit Nattif, about 20&#xA0;km (12&#xA0;mi) W of Bethlehem, is tentatively identified as the site.<strong>3. </strong>A town on the boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004321/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 16:8</a>) The surrounding area, &#x201C;the land of Tappuah,&#x201D; was allotted to Manasseh, but the city to Ephraim. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004321/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:8</a>) En-Tappuah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004321/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:7</a>) evidently refers to a nearby spring (Heb., <em>&#x2BD;A&#x2B9;yin, </em>or En, meaning &#x201C;fountain [spring],&#x201D; when used as a prefix) and may have been a more complete name used for the city of Tappuah.&#x201C;The king of Tappuah&#x201D; is mentioned among the rulers vanquished by Joshua in the conquest of Canaan (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004321/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 12:17</a>), and &#x201C;Tappuah&#x201D; here probably <span id=\"page1066\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1066\" data-before-text=\"1066\"></span>refers to the Ephraimite city. Ephraimite Tappuah is identified with Tell Sheikh Abu Zarad (Tel &#x2BC;Abu Zarad), about 13&#xA0;km (8&#xA0;mi) SSW of Shechem and just below the town of Yasuf."}
