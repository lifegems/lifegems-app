From Mount Zalmon, Abimelech and his forces cut wood with which to burn down the vault belonging to the city of Shechem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004656/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 9:48,&#xA0;49</a>) As the only mountains near Shechem are Ebal and Gerizim, Zalmon was either a peak or slope of one of these, or else it was some other less important hill nearby.<strong>3. </strong>A lofty peak evidently in Bashan, E of the Jordan. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004656/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 68:14,&#xA0;15</a>) It was perhaps the highest peak of Mount Hauran (Jebel ed Druz)."}
