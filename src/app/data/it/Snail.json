Numerous varieties of snails have been encountered in Palestine, but on account of the dry climate, there are few slugs, that is, snails having no visible shell. Both slugs and snails secrete a slimy substance that protects them from abrasive injury as they crawl along. Many believe that the snail&#x2019;s slimy trail is alluded to by the phrase &#x201C;a snail melting away.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004167/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 58:8</a>) Another suggestion is that the reference is to the drying up of the snail in its shell when exposed for some time to the sun."}
