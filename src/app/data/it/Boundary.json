Joshua, Eleazar the priest, and one chieftain out of each tribe were appointed by Jehovah to serve as a land committee overseeing the distribution.

Each one&#x2019;s inheritance should be given in proportion to his registered ones. Only by the lot should the land be apportioned.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 26:52-56;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> 33:53,&#xA0;54</a>.It thus appears that the distribution of the land among the tribes was governed by two factors: the result of the casting of the lot, and the size of the tribe. The lot may have established only the approximate location of the land inheritance each tribe would have, thus designating an inheritance in one section or another of the land, such as to the N or S, E or W, along the coastal plain, or in the mountainous region. The decision of the lot proceeded from Jehovah and hence would serve to prevent jealousy or quarreling among the tribes. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 16:33</a>) By this means God would also guide matters so that the situation of each tribe would fall in accordance with the inspired deathbed prophecy of the patriarch Jacob recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 49:1-33</a>.After the casting of the lot had determined the geographic location of a tribe, it would then be necessary to determine the extent of its territory on the basis of the second factor: its proportionate size. &#x201C;You must apportion the land to yourselves as a possession by lot according to your families. To the populous one you should increase his inheritance, and to the sparse one you should reduce his inheritance. To where the lot will come out for him, there it will become his.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 33:54</a>) The decision of the lot as to the basic geographic location would stand, but adjustment could be made as to the size of the inheritance. Thus, when Judah&#x2019;s territory was found to be too large, its land area was reduced by assigning portions of it to the tribe of Simeon.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:9</a>.The increasing or decreasing of the inheritance does not seem to have been merely on the basis of land area, for the tribe of Dan, though second most populous, received one of the smaller portions as to actual dimensions. Other factors, such as the number of cities, the type of land, and the quality of the soil, may have been considered.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:14-18</a>.When the more precise boundaries of the tribal divisions had been worked out, then the individual family holdings could be assigned, and this appears to have been done, not by lot, but by the direction of the appointed committee, composed of Eleazar, Joshua, and the chieftains. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:3,&#xA0;4</a>) So, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 19:14</a> states that &#x201C;when the <em>ancestors </em>will have set the boundaries in your inheritance&#x201D; they should not be moved back.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/0\">BOUNDARY MARK</a>.The account of the division of the territory W of the Jordan shows that first the lots for Judah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:1-63</a>), Joseph (Ephraim) (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 16:1-10</a>), and the half tribe of Manasseh settling W of the Jordan (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:1-13</a>) were determined, their boundaries and cities being enumerated. After this, there appears to have been an interruption of the dividing of the land, since the camp of Israel is shown to have moved from Gilgal to Shiloh. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 14:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/34/1\" data-bid=\"35-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:1</a>) The length of time involved is not stated, but Joshua eventually reprimanded the remaining seven tribes for their dilatory attitude as to settling the rest of the land. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 18:2,&#xA0;3</a>) Various explanations have been offered as to the cause of this attitude on the part of the seven tribes, some commentators reasoning that the abundance of spoil obtained during the conquest and the relative freedom from any immediate threat of attack by the Canaanites may have caused these tribes to feel no particular urgency about taking possession of the remaining portion of the territory. A reluctance to face up to the problem of dealing with the pockets of strong enemy resistance there may have contributed to this tardiness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000798/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:1-7</a>) Also, their knowledge of this portion of the Promised Land may have been considerably more limited than of those sections already allotted.To expedite the matter, Joshua sent out a delegation of 21 men, 3 from each of the 7 tribes, to &#x201C;map out the land into seven shares,&#x201D; and after the men had &#x201C;mapped it out by cities,&#x201D; Joshua drew lots for them in order to obtain Jehovah&#x2019;s decision.
