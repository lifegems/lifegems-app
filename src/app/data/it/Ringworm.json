The word occurs in the <em>New World Translation </em>at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003739/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Leviticus 21:20</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003739/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">22:22</a>, translating the Hebrew word <em>yal&#xB7;le&#x2B9;pheth. </em>Caused by fungi, ringworm is found on animals and man. In humans ringworm may attack not only the body&#x2019;s hairy parts, especially the scalp of children and the beard of adults, but also the nonhairy sections of the body. The latter form develops as a round, rose-colored spot usually having very small blisters around its edge. As the patch expands, the center clears up, giving the afflicted area its usual ringlike appearance.Though <em>yal&#xB7;le&#x2B9;pheth </em>has been rendered by other skin-disease terms, Jewish tradition connects it with Egyptian herpes or lichen. For <em>yal&#xB7;le&#x2B9;pheth </em>the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>translators used <em>lei&#xB7;khen&#x2B9;, </em>which can refer to ringworm. Thus Hebrew scholars L.&#xA0;Koehler and W.&#xA0;Baumgartner suggest &#x201C;ringworm, herpes.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;383.A man of priestly descent who had ringworm was disqualified from presenting offerings to Jehovah.
