Originally, the wife of wealthy Nabal from Maon, a city on the edge of the Wilderness of Judah, W of the Dead Sea. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Jos 15:20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;55</a>) She was &#x201C;good in discretion and beautiful in form,&#x201D; while her first husband, whose name means &#x201C;Senseless; Stupid,&#x201D; was &#x201C;harsh and bad in his practices.&#x201D;Following the prophet Samuel&#x2019;s death, David and his men moved into the area where the flocks of Abigail&#x2019;s husband were pastured. David&#x2019;s men thereafter were like a protective &#x201C;wall&#x201D; around Nabal&#x2019;s shepherds and flocks, night and day. So, when shearing time came, David sent some young men up to Carmel to call Nabal&#x2019;s attention to the good service rendered him and to request an offering of food from him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:4-8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 15,&#xA0;16</a>) But miserly Nabal screamed rebukes at them and insulted David as if he were an inconsequential person, and all of them as if they were possibly runaway slaves. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:9-11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;14</a>) This so angered David that he girded on his sword and led about 400 men toward Carmel to wipe out Nabal and the men of his household.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:12, 13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 21,&#xA0;22</a>.Abigail, hearing of the incident through a disturbed servant, showed her wise perception by immediately rounding up an ample supply of food and grain and then sent these ahead of her in care <span id=\"page21\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"21\" data-before-text=\"21\"></span>of her servants, much as Jacob had done before making contact with Esau. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:14-19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Ge 32:13-20</a>) Without saying anything to her husband, she rode to meet David, and in a long and fervent plea, which manifested wisdom and logic as well as respect and humility, she convinced David that her husband&#x2019;s senseless words did not justify the unrighteous shedding of blood or the failure to trust in Jehovah to settle the matter in a right way himself. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:14-20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 23-31</a>) David thanked God for the woman&#x2019;s good sense and quick action.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:32-35</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 25:21, 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:1,&#xA0;2</a>.Returning home, Abigail waited for her husband to sober up from a drunken feast and then informed him of her actions. Now &#x201C;his heart came to be dead inside him, and he himself became as a stone,&#x201D; and after ten days Jehovah caused him to expire. When the news reached David, he sent a marriage proposal to Abigail, which she did not hesitate to accept. She shared David&#x2019;s affections along with Ahinoam, a Jezreelitess, whom David had previously taken as wife. David&#x2019;s first wife, Michal, had already been given by her father Saul to another man.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:36-44</a>.Abigail was with David in Gath on the western edge of the Shephelah and later down in the NW Negeb at Ziklag. During David&#x2019;s absence a raiding party of Amalekites from the S burned Ziklag and carried off all the women and children, including Abigail and Ahinoam. Assured by Jehovah of success, David led his men in pursuit and, in a surprise attack, overcame the Amalekites and retrieved the captives and possessions.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 30:1-19</a>.Back at Ziklag, three days later, the news of Saul&#x2019;s death arrived. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 1:1,&#xA0;2</a>) Abigail now accompanied her husband to Hebron of Judah, where David was anointed as king. Here she gave birth to a son, Chileab (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 3:3</a>), also called Daniel at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 3:1</a>. David&#x2019;s wives increased to six in Hebron, and neither Abigail nor her son receive further mention in the account.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 3:2-5</a>.<strong>2. </strong>One of David&#x2019;s two sisters. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 2:13-17</a>) Some scholars believe that she was only a half sister, being related by mother but not by father. At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Samuel 17:25</a> Abigail is called &#x201C;the daughter of Nahash.&#x201D; Rabbinic tradition holds that Nahash is simply another name for Jesse, David&#x2019;s father. The Greek <em>Septuagint </em>(Lagardian edition) has &#x201C;Jesse&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Nahash&#x201D; in this verse. A number of modern translations also read this way. (See <em>AT; JB; NC </em>[Spanish].) However, it is noteworthy that the record at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 2:13-16</a> does not call Abigail and Zeruiah &#x2018;daughters of Jesse&#x2019; but rather &#x201C;sisters&#x201D; of Jesse&#x2019;s sons, including David. This allows for the possibility that their mother had first been married to a man named Nahash, to whom she bore Abigail and Zeruiah before becoming Jesse&#x2019;s wife and the mother of his sons. It cannot, therefore, be stated dogmatically that Abigail was the daughter of Jesse.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/0\">NAHASH</a> No.&#xA0;2.Abigail, David&#x2019;s sister, is mentioned as giving birth to only one son, Amasa. Her husband is referred to as Ithra the Israelite at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Samuel 17:25</a> but elsewhere is called Jether (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 2:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;32</a>) and at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 2:17</a> is spoken of as &#x201C;Jether the Ishmaelite.&#x201D; (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/1\">JETHER</a> No.&#xA0;6.) It is possible that Abigail contracted marriage with Jether during the time Jesse and his family were dwelling in the land of Moab. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 22:3,&#xA0;4</a>) Her son, Amasa, received no apparent attention during David&#x2019;s reign until Absalom&#x2019;s rebellion. His cousin Absalom then made him the head of his armed forces. Nevertheless, following Absalom&#x2019;s death, Abigail&#x2019;s brother, King David, dealt with her son Amasa in obtaining support for his return to the throne, and thereafter made Amasa the head of the army, replacing Joab. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 19:11-14</a>) This appointment soon brought death to Abigail&#x2019;s son, at the hands of his embittered cousin Joab.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000037/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 20:4-10</a>."}
