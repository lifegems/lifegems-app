Some scholars believe that in many cases the &#x201C;reed&#x201D; intended is <em>Arundo donax. </em>This plant is common in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. Its stem, terminating in a large plume of white flowers, has a diameter of 5 to 8&#xA0;cm (2 to 3&#xA0;in.) at the base and grows to a height of 2.5 to 5.5&#xA0;m (8 to 18&#xA0;ft). The leaves measure from 30 to 90&#xA0;cm (1 to 3&#xA0;ft) in length. The common reed (<em>Phragmites australis</em>) is also found in swamps and on the banks of rivers in Israel. It is a leafy grass 1.5 to 5&#xA0;m (5 to 16&#xA0;ft) high and has fluffy flower clusters atop its stiff, smooth stems.In mockery, Roman soldiers placed a reed, representative of a royal scepter, in Jesus&#x2019; right hand and later hit him with it. Also, a reed was used to convey a sponge soaked with sour wine to the impaled Jesus.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003670/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 27:29, 30,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003670/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 48;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003670/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 19:29</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003670/1\">HYSSOP</a>.The reed was also used for measuring. The <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003670/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">book of Ezekiel (40:5</a>) indicates that a measuring reed was 6 cubits long. So a reed based on the common cubit measured 2.67&#xA0;m (8.75 ft), and one based on the long cubit measured 3.11&#xA0;m (10.2&#xA0;ft).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003670/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Re 11:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003670/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:15, 16</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003670/2\">WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</a>.<strong>Figurative Use. </strong>&#x201C;Reed&#x201D; is used in the Bible to represent instability and frailty.
