For this reason, some scholars today accept Tulul Dura, 10&#xA0;km (6&#xA0;mi) SE of Babylon, as the most likely of the many proposed sites. The ruins of a dried-brick mound measuring 14&#xA0;m (46&#xA0;ft) square were discovered here and have been conjectured by some to be the base of Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s image. Nevertheless, the Akkadian term <em>duru, </em>meaning &#x201C;circuit,&#x201D; &#x201C;wall,&#x201D; or &#x201C;walled place,&#x201D; appears frequently in Mesopotamian place-names, making any positive identification impossible at this time."}
