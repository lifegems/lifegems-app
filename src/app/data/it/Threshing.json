If gleaners had a small amount to thresh, or if the grain was of small size like cumin, or if the threshing was done secretly during dangerous times, a rod or flail was used to beat the grain by hand, either on the ground or in a winepress.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004389/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 6:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004389/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ru 2:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004389/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 28:27</a>.The threshing floor, however, was the location of normal threshing operations. Usually situated on a higher elevation exposed to the wind, it consisted of a flat circular area, up to 15&#xA0;m (50&#xA0;ft) in diameter, made either of stone or hard-packed earth. Threshing floors not privately owned were often clustered together near a village for communal use. The sheaves of barley or wheat, the principal grains of Palestine, were spread out on the floor (today generally to a depth of 30 to 46&#xA0;cm [12 to 18&#xA0;in.]). The treading by bulls or other animals, as they constantly circled the floor, gradually broke down the straw and freed the grain from the chaff. The animals were not muzzled while treading the grain.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004389/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">De 25:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004389/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Ho 10:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004389/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 9:9,&#xA0;10</a>.Threshing instruments pulled by animals speeded up the process and were more thorough than animal hooves alone.

Such sledges and roller devices covered an additional swath each round, and the added weight of the driver riding on top increased the effectiveness.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004389/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 28:28</a>.After the grain had been thoroughly threshed, and turned over several times in the process, it was winnowed.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004389/0\">WINNOWING</a>.Because of providing an open, level space, threshing floors were often used for other purposes. The mourning rites for Jacob were held on the threshing floor of Atad near the Jordan.
