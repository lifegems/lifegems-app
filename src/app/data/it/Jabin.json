Jabin formed a confederation of northern Canaanite kings, and these amassed against Israel a force &#x201C;as numerous as the grains of sand .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. [including] very many horses and war chariots.&#x201D; When camped at the waters of Merom, their combined armies were defeated by Joshua&#x2019;s surprise attack and follow-up pursuit. Jabin was executed when Hazor itself was later captured and burned.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002272/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 11:1-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002272/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 12:7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002272/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;19</a>.<strong>2. </strong>A later Canaanite king who ruled from the restored Hazor; possibly a descendant of No.&#xA0;1. Jabin&#x2019;s being called &#x201C;the king of Canaan&#x201D; might denote supremacy over the other Canaanite kings, granting him exceptional power and authority; it does appear that there were others at least allied with him. On the other hand, the expression might merely distinguish him from kings of other lands. Jabin&#x2019;s army, including 900 chariots with iron scythes, was under the command of Sisera, who takes greater prominence in the account than Jabin himself.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002272/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002272/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 5:19,&#xA0;20</a>.By Jehovah&#x2019;s permission, Jabin harshly oppressed apostate Israel 20 years. But on their calling to God for deliverance, Jehovah raised up Barak and Deborah to lead Israel to victory over Jabin&#x2019;s army. Sisera was killed by the wife of Heber the Kenite, who had been at peace with Jabin. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002272/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:3-22</a>) The Israelites continued warring against Jabin and finally put him to death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002272/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:23, 24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002272/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 83:9,&#xA0;10</a>."}
