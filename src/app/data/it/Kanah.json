This small stream rises in the hill country a few kilometers SW of Nablus and, as the Wadi Ishkar, flows in a southwesterly direction and then joins the Wadi Yarkon (Nahal Yarqon), which empties into the Mediterranean Sea N of Tel Aviv-Yafo. However, some scholars believe that in Joshua&#x2019;s day the lower course of the Wadi Qanah perhaps flowed directly into the Mediterranean at a point about 10&#xA0;km (6&#xA0;mi) farther N.<strong>2. </strong>A boundary city of Asher.
