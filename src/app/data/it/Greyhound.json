There is considerable uncertainty, though, as to what is designated by the Hebrew expression, which literally means &#x201C;the [animal] girded in at the hips (loins).&#x201D; A number of Bible translations use &#x201C;greyhound&#x201D; in the main text at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001772/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 30:31</a>, but in footnotes list &#x201C;war-horse&#x201D; and &#x201C;rooster&#x201D; as alternate renderings. (<em>AS, NW, Ro</em>) The reading &#x201C;rooster&#x201D; or &#x201C;cock&#x201D; (<em>AT, Dy, JB, Kx, Mo, RS</em>) has the support of the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>and the Latin <em>Vulgate. </em>&#x201C;Greyhound&#x201D; is an appropriate rendering, however, for it fits the description of an animal that does well with its &#x201C;pacing.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001772/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 30:29</a>) The greyhound has been clocked at a speed of about 64&#xA0;km/<wbr>hr (40&#xA0;mph). Also, the slenderness of the greyhound&#x2019;s lumbar regions, as if the animal were &#x201C;girded in at the hips,&#x201D; would harmonize with what is considered to be the literal significance of the Hebrew designation."}
