Othniel was &#x201C;the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#x2019;s younger brother.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Jos 15:17</a>) While this grammatical structure allows for either Othniel or Kenaz to be Caleb&#x2019;s younger brother, to harmonize with other texts Othniel must be viewed as Caleb&#x2019;s nephew, the son of Caleb&#x2019;s brother Kenaz. Thus certain translations read: &#x201C;Othniel, the son of Caleb&#x2019;s younger brother, Kenaz.&#x201D; (<em>AT, Mo</em>) Additionally, Caleb was &#x201C;the son of Jephunneh,&#x201D; hence not a son of Kenaz as was Othniel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 32:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 4:15</a>.Othniel&#x2019;s marriage to Achsah the daughter of Caleb came as a result of his victory over the Canaanite stronghold of Debir. Achsah&#x2019;s father Caleb had promised her to the conqueror of the city.

Years later a descendant was chosen from this family to head a service group of 24,000 during David&#x2019;s reign.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 4:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 27:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;15</a>.Israel&#x2019;s first oppression by foreign kings due to disobedience lasted for eight years. When they &#x201C;began to call to Jehovah for aid,&#x201D; He raised up Othniel to deliver them. With Jehovah&#x2019;s spirit upon him, Othniel defeated Cushan-rishathaim, &#x201C;the king of Syria,&#x201D; and took general oversight and rendered judicial decisions among his brothers.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003349/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 3:8-11</a>."}
