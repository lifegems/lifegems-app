In a number of versions it is rendered &#x201C;Armageddon.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001884/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Re 16:14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001884/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 16</a>, <em>AT; KJ; JB; RS; TEV</em>) The name Har&#x2013;Magedon, taken from Hebrew, means simply &#x201C;Mountain of Megiddo.&#x201D;There does not appear to have been a literal place called &#x201C;Mountain of Megiddo,&#x201D; either inside or outside the Promised Land, before or during the days of the apostle John, who recorded the vision. Hence, Har&#x2013;Magedon evidently draws its significance from the events associated with the ancient city of Megiddo.Megiddo was situated a few miles SE of Mount Carmel, overlooking and dominating the Plain of Esdraelon (Jezreel) and controlling major N-S and E-W trade and military routes. Joshua first conquered this Canaanite city. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001884/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 12:7, 8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001884/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;21</a>) Near this site Jabin&#x2019;s army under command of Sisera was later destroyed. Jehovah there employed natural forces to assist the Israelite army under Barak. The account reads: &#x201C;Barak went descending from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men behind him. And Jehovah began to throw Sisera and all his war chariots and all the camp into confusion by the edge of the sword before Barak. Finally Sisera got down off the chariot and took to flight on foot. And Barak chased after the war chariots and the camp as far as Harosheth of the nations, so that all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. Not as much as one remained.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001884/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:14-16</a>.After the victory, Barak and the prophetess Deborah broke out in song, which went, in part: &#x201C;Kings came, they fought; it was then that the kings of Canaan fought in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo. No gain of silver did they take. From heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera. The torrent of Kishon washed them away, the torrent of ancient days, the torrent of Kishon. You went treading down strength, O&#xA0;my soul. It was then that the hoofs of horses pawed because of dashings upon dashings of his stallions.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001884/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 5:19-22</a>.It was at Megiddo that King Ahaziah of Judah died after he was mortally wounded on orders of Jehu. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001884/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 9:27</a>) There King Josiah of Judah was killed in an encounter with Pharaoh Nechoh.

In view of the context, it is to a &#x201C;place&#x201D; in the last-mentioned sense that earth&#x2019;s combined military powers are marching.&#x201C;The war of the great day of God the Almighty&#x201D; at Har&#x2013;Magedon was not some past event but is depicted in Revelation as future from <span id=\"page1038\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1038\" data-before-text=\"1038\"></span>the time of John&#x2019;s vision. The gathering of the kings to Har&#x2013;Magedon is described as being a result of the pouring out of the sixth of the seven bowls containing the &#x201C;last&#x201D; plagues that will bring to a finish the anger of God.
