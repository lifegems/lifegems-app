(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 1:13,&#xA0;14</a>) In the first century C.E., Judaism in its various forms was not based exclusively on the Hebrew Scriptures. One of the most prominent divisions of Judaism, that of the Sadducees, rejected the Scriptural teaching of the resurrection and denied the existence of angels. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 12:18-27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 23:8</a>) Although the Pharisees, who formed yet another important branch of Judaism, sharply disagreed with the Sadducees on this (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 23:6-9</a>), they were guilty of making God&#x2019;s Word invalid because of their many unscriptural traditions. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 15:1-11</a>) Not the Law, which was actually a tutor leading to Christ (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 3:24</a>), but these unscriptural traditions made it difficult for many to accept Christ. The Law itself was good and holy (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 7:12</a>), but the traditions of men served to enslave the Jews. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Col 2:8</a>) It was an ardent zeal for &#x2018;the traditions of his fathers&#x2019; that caused Saul (Paul) to be a vicious persecutor of Christians.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 1:13, 14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 23</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/0\">PHARISEES</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002540/1\">SADDUCEES</a>."}
