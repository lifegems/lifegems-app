(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002684/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:19</a>) Its exact location is uncertain. Either Lasha was &#x201C;near&#x201D; Zeboiim (<em>NW; JP </em>[1962 ed.]) or the Canaanite boundary extended from the area around Zeboiim &#x201C;as far as&#x201D; Lasha. (<em>AT; RS</em>; <em>JB</em>) On the basis of Jerome&#x2019;s identification and Jewish tradition, many place Lasha at Callirrhoe, near the eastern shore of the Dead Sea below the Wadi Zarqa Ma&#x2BD;in. Others link Lasha with Laish (Dan)."}
