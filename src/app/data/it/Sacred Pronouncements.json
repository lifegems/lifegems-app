Originally <em>lo&#x2B9;gi&#xB7;on </em>meant only a brief sacred utterance, but in time it came to signify any divine communication or oracle. Certain English versions render <em>lo&#x2B9;gi&#xB7;on </em>simply as &#x2018;oracle.&#x2019; (<em>AS, KJ, RS</em>) Wuest&#x2019;s translation uses &#x201C;divine utterances&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 7:38</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 3:2</a>.Stephen spoke of the Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai as &#x201C;living sacred pronouncements.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 7:38</a>) The apostle Paul referred to the entire Hebrew Scriptures and evidently also to all the inspired Christian Scriptures written up to that time, saying: &#x201C;What, then, is the superiority of the Jew, or what is the benefit of the circumcision? A great deal in every way. First of all, because they were entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 3:1,&#xA0;2</a>) Therefore, the writing of this body of inspired Scriptures was committed to Jews, writing &#x201C;as they were borne along by holy spirit.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 1:20,&#xA0;21</a>.In the letter to the Hebrews the apostle Paul includes as &#x201C;sacred pronouncements&#x201D; the teachings delivered to mankind by the Lord Jesus Christ, his apostles, and other inspired Christian writers. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 5:12</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 6:1,&#xA0;2</a>.) Peter also reflects this broad scope in speaking to the followers of Christ, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Peter 4:11</a>: &#x201C;If anyone speaks, let him speak as it were the sacred pronouncements of God.&#x201D; He also classifies writings of the apostle Paul as of equal authority with &#x201C;the rest of the Scriptures.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 3:15,&#xA0;16</a>.The Greek <em>Septuagint </em>frequently uses the word <em>lo&#x2B9;gi&#xB7;on, </em>as in translating <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003790/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 12:6</a> (11:6, <em>LXX</em>): &#x201C;The <em>sayings </em>of Jehovah are pure <em>sayings.&#x201D; </em>Bagster&#x2019;s English translation of the <em>Septuagint </em>reads, at this verse: &#x201C;The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles.&#x201D;"}
