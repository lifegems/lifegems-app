The Hebrew terms for neck evidently emphasize its skeletal structure that can be broken (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 13:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 4:18</a>) or the back part of the neck.

Therefore, to &#x2018;have one&#x2019;s hand on the back of the neck&#x2019; of his enemies was to conquer, or subdue, them. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 22:41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Ps 18:40</a>) With similar significance, on monuments of Egypt and Assyria, monarchs are represented in battle scenes as treading on the necks of their enemies. Likewise, Joshua ordered his army commanders: &#x201C;Come forward. Place your feet on the back of the necks of these kings.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 10:24</a>.A yoke upon the neck indicated servitude, submission, or bondage.

As a warning to us, the Scriptures say that &#x201C;a man repeatedly reproved but making his neck hard will suddenly be broken, and that without healing.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 29:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> De 9:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/6/3\" data-bid=\"7-4\" class=\"b\"> 31:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/6/4\" data-bid=\"7-5\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 17:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/6/5\" data-bid=\"7-6\" class=\"b\"> Ps 75:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/6/6\" data-bid=\"7-7\" class=\"b\"> Isa 48:4</a>.<strong>Throat. </strong>The Hebrew word for &#x201C;throat&#x201D; evidently refers to the front part of the neck where the organs for speaking and swallowing are found.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 3:16</a>) Of wicked men of lies and bloodshed, the Bible says: &#x201C;In their mouth there is nothing trustworthy; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. their throat is an opened burial place.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 5:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003204/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 3:13</a>."}
