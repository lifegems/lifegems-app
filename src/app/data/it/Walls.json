As long as man has been constructing houses and cities, he has been building walls out of many materials, in a variety of designs, to serve a number of purposes. The size and strength of structures largely depend on the construction of the walls and the materials used in making them.The walls of David&#x2019;s palace were of cut stone. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004572/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 5:11</a>) Similarly, the outside walls of Solomon&#x2019;s temple, it appears, were of quarried stone, with some of their interior surfaces covered over with cedar boards.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004572/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Da 5:5</a>) The walls of the homes of the people in general were usually of simple construction<wbr>&#x2014;sun-dried bricks, uncut stones, or plastered material over a wooden framework. Sometimes the surface was whitewashed.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004572/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 23:3</a>.<strong>City Walls. </strong>In ancient times fear caused people to erect protective walls around large cities to prevent enemy invasion.

The Mosaic Law made a legal distinction between walled and unwalled towns, as to the rights of house owners. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004572/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Le 25:29-31</a>) The walls not only provided a physical barrier between city residences and an enemy but also afforded an elevated position atop which the defenders could protect the walls from being undermined, tunneled through, or breached by battering rams.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004572/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Job 24:11</a>) These walls were of a fairly permanent nature, built of undressed fieldstones and sometimes set in clay or mortar.<strong>Symbolic Walls. </strong>In the Scriptures, walls are sometimes mentioned in a figurative way as pictorial of protection and safety (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004572/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004572/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 18:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004572/12/2\" data-bid=\"13-3\" class=\"b\"> 25:28</a>) or as a symbol of separation.

However, when Paul wrote to the Ephesians in 60 or 61&#xA0;C.E., though he may have alluded to it in an illustrative way, he actually did not mean that the literal wall had been abolished, for it was still standing. Rather, the apostle had in mind the Law covenant, which had acted as a dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles for centuries. On the basis of Christ&#x2019;s death nearly 30 years previously, that symbolic &#x201C;wall&#x201D; had been abolished.Jeremiah was told he would be like fortified walls of copper against those that opposed him.
