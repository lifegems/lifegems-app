(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001432/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 4:24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001432/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;32</a>) Its location is uncertain, although some connect it with Tell &#x2BD;Eitum (Tel &#x2BD;Aitun), centrally located in Judah&#x2019;s territory about 44&#xA0;km (27&#xA0;mi) W of En-gedi and the same distance SW of Jerusalem.<strong>2. </strong>The crag Etam, where Samson lived after burning the Philistines&#x2019; fields. From this crag, 3,000 men of Judah took him, willingly bound, back to the Philistines. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001432/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 15:8-13</a>) Whereas no positive identification for the crag Etam is possible, a connection with the town (No.&#xA0;3 below) cannot be altogether eliminated. However, just 4&#xA0;km (2.5&#xA0;mi) ESE of the suggested site of Samson&#x2019;s hometown Zorah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001432/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 13:2</a>) is &#x2BD;Araq Isma&#x2BD;in, an isolated crag with a lofty cavern affording a broad view of the Shephelah below. Appropriate to the meaning of the name, this may possibly be the site of the crag Etam.<strong>3. </strong>A town of Judah located probably at Khirbet el-Khokh, on a hill about 2.5&#xA0;km (1.5&#xA0;mi) SW of Bethlehem. Apparently Etam and Bethlehem had been settled by close relatives. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001432/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 4:3,&#xA0;4</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001432/0\">ATROTH-BETH-JOAB</a>.) According to Josephus, King Solomon often took a morning chariot ride from Jerusalem those 13&#xA0;km (8&#xA0;mi) out to Etan (Etam), where there were gardens and streams. (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>VIII, 186 [vii,&#xA0;3]) Etam was rebuilt and fortified by Solomon&#x2019;s successor Rehoboam. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001432/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 11:5,&#xA0;6</a>) According to the Talmud, an aqueduct linked Jerusalem with a spring to the W of Etam.<wbr>&#x2014;Babylonian Talmud, <em>Yoma </em>31<em>a; </em>Palestinian (Jerusalem) Talmud, <em>Yoma </em>41<em>a.</em>"}
