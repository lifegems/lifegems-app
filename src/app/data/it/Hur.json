Some of Hur&#x2019;s descendants may have settled in Bethlehem.

When, shortly after leaving Egypt, Israel was attacked by the Amalekites, Hur accompanied Moses and Aaron to the top of a hill where he and Aaron supported Moses&#x2019; hands until Jehovah gave Israel the victory over the Amalekites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002108/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 17:8-13</a>) On one occasion not long thereafter, Moses and Joshua went up on Mount Sinai to receive more of the Law, leaving Hur and Aaron in charge of the camp. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002108/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 24:12-14</a>) He is likely the same Hur (No.&#xA0;1) as the grandfather of the tabernacle craftsman Bezalel. Josephus wrote that Hur was Miriam&#x2019;s husband, but the Bible does not say anything about this.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>III, 54 (ii,&#xA0;4).<strong>3. </strong>A king of Midian, one of five dominated by Amorite King Sihon until Israel, moving toward the Promised Land, defeated Sihon.
