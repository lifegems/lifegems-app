Both the house cricket and the field cricket are to be found in Bible lands. Sole mention is made of this insect at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001072/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Leviticus 11:22</a>, where it is listed as being clean for food.A number of Bible translations (<em>KJ; Yg</em>) render the Hebrew term <em>char&#xB7;gol&#x2B9; </em>as &#x201C;beetle,&#x201D; the most typical species of which creep rather than jump. But it is generally agreed that the Hebrew word refers to a kind of leaping insect, as indicated by its being listed along with the locust. There is uncertainty, though, as to the exact leaping insect meant. Translators have variously rendered <em>char&#xB7;gol&#x2B9; </em>as &#x201C;dropping locust&#x201D; (<em>Mo</em>), &#x201C;flying locust&#x201D; (<em>AT</em>), and &#x201C;cricket&#x201D; (<em>AS; NW; RS</em>); and at times the Hebrew word has simply been transliterated.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Le; Da; JB.</em>"}
