It is composed of aluminum oxide containing minute traces of chromium and iron oxide that impart the red color. It is very rare, slightly inferior to the diamond in hardness, and when of excellent quality and large size, it may exceed a diamond of the same size in value. Colors range from rose to the highly appraised deep bluish red often identified as &#x201C;pigeon blood&#x201D; red. &#x201C;Ruby,&#x201D; as used in the <em>New World Translation, </em>is translated from two Hebrew words (<em>&#x2BC;o&#x2B9;dhem; kadh&#xB7;kodh&#x2B9;</em>) that evidently both denote bright redness or extreme redness.The first stone in the first row of gems on High Priest Aaron&#x2019;s &#x201C;breastpiece of judgment&#x201D; was a ruby, and engraved upon it was the name of one of the 12 tribes of Israel.

Commercial Tyre eagerly traded its stores for these and other goods.
