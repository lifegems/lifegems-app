Concerning the order of the titles in Assyrian eponym lists, James B.&#xA0;Pritchard, editor of <em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts </em>(1974, p.&#xA0;274), comments: &#x201C;Later on, the position of the official within the hierarchy was decisive for the sequence, the highest official (<em>tartanu</em>) following the king immediately, while important palace officers .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. and the governors of the foremost provinces took their turn in well-established order.&#x201D; (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004328/0\">CHRONOLOGY</a> [Eponym (limmu) lists].) An inscription by Assyrian King Ashurbanipal, now in the British Museum, reads, in part: &#x201C;I became very angry on account of these happenings, my soul was aflame. I called the <em>turtan -</em>official, the governors, and also their assistants and gave immediately the order.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>p.&#xA0;296.King Sennacherib sent the Tartan along with other officials, including the Rabshakeh, the king&#x2019;s chief cupbearer who acted as spokesman, to deliver an ultimatum of capitulation to Jerusalem. The Tartan is listed first, possibly because his was the superior position.
