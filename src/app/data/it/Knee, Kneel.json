Hence, wobbling or enfeebled knees portray weakness; and knocking knees, fear.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 4:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 109:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 35:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Da 5:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> Heb 12:12</a>.All except 300 of Gideon&#x2019;s 10,000 men bent down upon their knees to drink, apparently putting their faces down to the water. In this position they could not be alert, prepared in case of a surprise attack. They were more concerned with slaking their thirst than with the issue at hand. On the other hand, the 300 remained on their feet, picking up the water and lapping it out of their hands, alert, watchful, ready. The 9,700 negligent ones were therefore dismissed.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 7:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 5-8</a>.Figuratively, a child said to be &#x2018;born upon the knees&#x2019; of a person other than the mother, and thus enjoying that one&#x2019;s favor and care, was acknowledged as that person&#x2019;s child, or descendant, just as Bilhah&#x2019;s child was counted as Rachel&#x2019;s.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 30:3-6</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 50:23</a>.Jehovah promised restoration for his people and likened them to children of Zion, or Jerusalem, who would be &#x2018;fondled upon the knees,&#x2019; that is, well cared for, brought back into a favored state.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002640/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 66:12,&#xA0;13</a>.<strong>Kneeling. </strong>The Hebrew word for &#x201C;kneel&#x201D; (<em>ba&#xB7;rakh&#x2B9;</em>) possibly has the same root as the one for &#x201C;blessing,&#x201D; which may indicate that at least at times blessings were conferred upon persons while they knelt.<strong><em>While imploring favor. </em></strong>A person might kneel as an act of respect or to implore favor, as when a &#x201C;chief of fifty&#x201D; representing King Ahaziah knelt before Elijah to plead for his life and that of the men accompanying him.
