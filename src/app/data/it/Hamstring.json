Hamstringing, the act of cutting these tendons, cripples the animal and renders it unfit for work or warfare. The arbitrariness of Jacob&#x2019;s sons Simeon and Levi found expression in their hamstringing bulls, likely when executing vengeance on the Hivites of Shechem.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001846/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 11:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001846/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001846/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 8:3,&#xA0;4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001846/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 18:3,&#xA0;4</a>) This was the simplest method of putting horses out of the battle, and after being disabled in this way, the horses undoubtedly were killed, destroyed along with the war chariots. By not appropriating to themselves the horses of their enemies and then using them in warfare, the Israelites would be safeguarded from being ensnared into relying on horses instead of on Jehovah for protection.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001846/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">De 17:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001846/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 31:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001846/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;3</a>."}
