Although castration is the method ordinarily employed for breaking bulls for service as draft animals, apparently this was not practiced by the Israelites, for a mutilated animal was unfit for sacrifice.

It has, therefore, been suggested that the breed used by the Israelites may have been of a gentle temper.The male of beef cattle has occupied a prominent place in the religions of many pagan peoples. Whether because of its great strength or its potential as sire of numerous offspring, it has been honored, even worshiped. The Babylonians employed the bull as the symbol of their principal god, Marduk. In Egypt living bulls were venerated as incarnations of a god<wbr>&#x2014;Apis at Memphis and Mnevis at Heliopolis. The occurrence of the bull, Taurus, as one of the primary signs of the zodiac offers additional evidence of the important place accorded the bull in pagan religions.Shortly after the Exodus, even the Israelites, likely because of being contaminated by the religious concepts with which they became acquainted while in Egypt, exchanged Jehovah&#x2019;s glory for &#x201C;a representation of a bull.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000838/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 106:19,&#xA0;20</a>) Later, the first king of the ten-tribe kingdom, Jeroboam, set up calf worship at Dan and Bethel.

If the high priest committed a sin that brought guiltiness upon the people, he was required to offer a bull, the largest and most valuable sacrificial victim, this undoubtedly in keeping with his responsible position as leader of Israel in true worship. A bull also had to be offered when the entire assembly of Israel made a mistake. <span id=\"page375\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"375\" data-before-text=\"375\"></span>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000838/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Le 4:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000838/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> 13,&#xA0;14</a>) On Atonement Day a bull was to be offered in behalf of the priestly house of Aaron.

The apostle Paul applied to God&#x2019;s Christian servants the principle embodied in the Law with respect to not muzzling a bull while it is threshing, indicating that just as the working bull was entitled to feed on the grain it was threshing, likewise the one sharing spiritual things with others is worthy of receiving material provisions.
