{"title":"Zechariah, Book of","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200004682","html":"<span id=\"page1225\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1225\" data-before-text=\"1225\"></span><strong>ZECHARIAH, BOOK OF</strong>This book of the Hebrew Scriptures identifies its writer as &#x201C;Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 1:1</a>) It also provides a basis for establishing the time period covered and an approximate date for the composition. The last time indicator found in the book of Zechariah is the fourth day of Chislev in the fourth year of Darius&#x2019; reign (about December&#xA0;1, 518&#xA0;B.C.E.). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">7:1</a>) Accordingly, this book could not have been committed to writing before the close of 518&#xA0;B.C.E. Since it was in the &#x201C;eighth month in the second year of Darius&#x201D; (October/<wbr>November&#xA0;520&#xA0;B.C.E.) that &#x201C;the word of Jehovah occurred to Zechariah&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1:1</a>), the book covers a period of at least two years.From <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">chapter&#xA0;9</a> onward the subject matter found in the book of Zechariah appears to differ considerably from the earlier section. No further reference is made to angels and visions or to Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua. There is no mention of the temple-rebuilding work, and not even the name of Zechariah appears. In view of this and the nature of the prophecies contained in the latter chapters of the book, a number of critics maintain that this section could not have been written by Zechariah. However, it should be noted that Zechariah, like other prophets, wrote according to divine inspiration and did not receive all revelations at the same time or in the same manner. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 1:20,&#xA0;21</a>) Also, prophecies did not have to fit within a particular framework of existing circumstances and incorporate the name of the prophet or of some of his contemporaries for an entire book to be the work of the prophet. That the book of Zechariah forms one harmonious whole, instead of consisting of separate and unrelated parts <span id=\"page1226\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1226\" data-before-text=\"1226\"></span>recorded by different writers, is evident from the thoughts expressed therein. Throughout, the book highlights that Jerusalem would be restored and that Jehovah would come to the defense of the city.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 1:13-21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:4,&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 8:14-23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/5/3\" data-bid=\"6-4\" class=\"b\"> 9:11-17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/5/4\" data-bid=\"6-5\" class=\"b\"> 12:2-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/5/5\" data-bid=\"6-6\" class=\"b\"> 14:3-21</a>.<strong>Historical Background. </strong>About February&#xA0;9, 519&#xA0;B.C.E., the prophet Zechariah heard the words: &#x201C;The whole earth is sitting still and having no disturbance.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 1:7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;11</a>) At that time Jerusalem was not a disturbing factor to the nations, but it appeared to observers that Jehovah had forsaken the city. Although the temple&#x2019;s foundation had been laid in 536&#xA0;B.C.E., the rebuilding work made slow progress on account of enemy opposition and finally, in 522&#xA0;B.C.E., came under an official ban. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 4:4, 5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;24</a>) Additionally, plagued by droughts and crop failures because of having neglected the temple rebuilding work, the repatriated Jews found themselves in very difficult circumstances. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Hag 1:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 10,&#xA0;11</a>) They needed encouragement to continue the construction work despite mountainous obstacles.Jehovah&#x2019;s words, through Zechariah, must therefore have been a real source of comfort and inspiration to them. The visions seen by Zechariah clearly showed that it was the divine will for Jerusalem and its temple to be rebuilt. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 1:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> chap&#xA0;2</a>) The power of the nations that had dispersed Judah would be shattered. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">1:18-21</a>) High Priest Joshua would gain an acceptable appearance before Jehovah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">3:3-7</a>), and Governor Zerubbabel would, with the help of God&#x2019;s spirit, finish rebuilding the temple.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004682/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">4:6-9</a>.<strong>Agreement With Other Bible Books. </strong>The book of Zechariah is in complete harmony with the rest of the Scriptures in identifying Jehovah as the Protector of his people.
