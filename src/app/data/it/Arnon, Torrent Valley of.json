This torrent, the Wadi Mujib (Nahal Arnon), is fed by numerous tributaries (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 21:14</a>) and, after the Jordan, is the only important stream emptying into the Dead Sea. The sheer red and yellow sandstone cliffs drop down abruptly to flank the sides of the narrow valley with its small perennial stream of limpid waters, replete with fish. Alongside grow willows, oleanders, and other vegetation in abundance. Where the stream leaves the steep chasm walls to enter the flat shore of the Dead Sea its size varies from 12 to 30&#xA0;m (40 to 100&#xA0;ft) in width, with a flow of from 0.3 to 1.2&#xA0;m (1 to 4&#xA0;ft) in depth.The formidable canyon, which, at the top, measures some 3&#xA0;km (2&#xA0;mi) in width and is nearly 520&#xA0;m (1,700&#xA0;ft) deep, was crossed by only a few passages (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 16:2</a>) and hence became an obvious natural boundary. At the time of the Israelite conquest it separated the Amorites on the N from the Moabites on the S (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 21:13</a>), but Jephthah&#x2019;s <span id=\"page178\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"178\" data-before-text=\"178\"></span>message to the Ammonites shows that the side to the N had once been under Ammonite control and had been invaded by the Amorites prior to Israel&#x2019;s arrival. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 11:12-27</a>) Israel, having skirted the territory of Moab, reached the Arnon, probably at its upper reaches. Attacked by Sihon, the Amorite king, Israel gained the victory and took possession of the land from the Arnon up to the Jabbok. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 21:21-24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> De 2:24-36</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/0\">JABBOK, TORRENT VALLEY OF</a>.) This first conquest thereafter became the territory of the tribes of Reuben and Gad.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">De 3:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Jos 12:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 13:8, 9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/5/3\" data-bid=\"6-4\" class=\"b\"> 15-28</a>.Because of Jehu&#x2019;s failure to walk strictly according to Jehovah&#x2019;s law, this region was later overrun by the invading forces of Hazael of Syria.

Archaeological discoveries give evidence of a number of forts and bridges in the area testifying to the strategic importance of the Arnon. Its name figures in prophecies directed against Moab.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 16:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000380/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 48:20</a>.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;177]</strong>View toward the north across the torrent valley of Arnon"}
