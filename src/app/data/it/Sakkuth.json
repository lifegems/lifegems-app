However, in the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>the expression &#x201C;Sakkuth your king&#x201D; reads &#x201C;the tent of Moloch,&#x201D; and Stephen, who probably quoted the <em>Septuagint, </em>also used the words &#x201C;the tent of Moloch.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003797/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 7:43</a>) This suggests that &#x201C;Sakkuth&#x201D; may have been a portable shrine, a tent or booth, in which the idol image of Moloch was housed.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003797/0\">ASTROLOGERS</a> (Molech and Astrology in Israel)."}
