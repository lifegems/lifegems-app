The southern province was eventually designated by the name Dalmatia.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002148/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 15:19</a> the apostle Paul speaks of preaching in a circuit &#x201C;as far as Illyricum.&#x201D; Whether the original Greek is to be understood to mean that Paul actually preached in or merely up to Illyricum cannot be established with certainty."}
