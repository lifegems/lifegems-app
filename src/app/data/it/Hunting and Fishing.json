Also, pits were dug and then camouflaged with a thin cover of sticks and earth. Animals were trapped by being made to flee over the covering. In addition, snares that entangled the animals&#x2019; feet were used, and a combination of pits and nets may also have been employed.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002104/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Job 18:8-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002104/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 18:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002104/13/2\" data-bid=\"14-3\" class=\"b\"> 48:42-44</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002104/1\">BIRDCATCHER</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002104/2\">TRAP</a>.<strong>Fishing. </strong>Among the Hebrews fishing was an occupation; it is not mentioned as being done merely for sport.
