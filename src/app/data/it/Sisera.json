Sisera, who lived at Harosheth rather than at Jabin&#x2019;s city Hazor, is more prominent in the account than King Jabin. Sometime after Judge Ehud had overthrown Moabite domination, Sisera and Jabin came to oppress Israel for 20 years.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004147/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004147/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 12:9</a>.On hearing that Deborah and Barak had mustered the Israelites to fight against him, Sisera collected his forces, including his 900 iron-scythed chariots, and confronted Israel at the torrent valley of Kishon. But Jehovah fought against Sisera and threw his whole army into confusion, resulting in their total defeat.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004147/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004147/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 12-16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004147/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004147/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> 5:20, 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004147/1/4\" data-bid=\"2-5\" class=\"b\"> Ps 83:9</a>.His chariots bogged down (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004147/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 5:21</a>), and Sisera fled on foot, coming to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, who was at peace with Jabin. She invited him inside. Exhausted from the battle and the flight, the weary Sisera, depending on the safety of Jael&#x2019;s tent, decided to rest. Jael gave Sisera some milk to drink, and he asked her to stand guard. When he had fallen into a sound sleep, she stealthily went up to him and drove a tent pin through his temples into the earth. When Barak arrived, Jael presented to him the fallen enemy.
