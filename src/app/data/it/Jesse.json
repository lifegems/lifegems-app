After King Saul turned away from true worship, Jehovah sent Samuel to Jesse&#x2019;s home to anoint one of his sons as king. Jesse brought in the seven older boys, but when Jehovah chose none of these Jesse was obliged to call his youngest son David from pasturing the sheep; this son was Jehovah&#x2019;s choice.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002449/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 16:1-13</a>.When Saul summoned David to play the soothing harp for him, aged Jesse sent along a generous gift and later granted permission for David to remain some time in attendance at Saul&#x2019;s court.
