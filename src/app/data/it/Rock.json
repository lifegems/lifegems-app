Both terms are used literally and figuratively in the Scriptures. The two are found in parallel at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003751/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Samuel 22:2, 3</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003751/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 18:2</a>: &#x201C;Jehovah is my crag .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. My God is my rock.&#x201D;The Bible preserves the names of certain crags and rocks. For example, the Midianite prince Oreb was killed by Gideon&#x2019;s men at a rock called Oreb, evidently so named because of this incident.
