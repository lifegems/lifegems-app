Although there is some dispute as to which modern musical instrument corresponds to the Hebrew <em>cha&#xB7;lil&#x2B9; </em>and its Greek equivalent <em>au&#xB7;los&#x2B9;, </em>many modern translations render the words as &#x201C;flute,&#x201D; in harmony with the identification given by lexicographers.

Egyptian inscriptions indicate that a variety of flutelike instruments existed in that country. One type was held in an oblique position, with the mouth against the side of the instrument; they also developed a double flute, with the mouth at the end of the two pipes.The Greek <em>au&#xB7;los&#x2B9; </em>appears to have been used also as a general designation that included instruments of two types: those utilizing a reed in the mouthpiece, as well as simple flutelike pipes. <em>Cha&#xB7;lil&#x2B9; </em>may also have come to be a general term for all woodwinds, but in modern Hebrew the name is applied only to the flute, and traditional Jewish belief is that the <em>cha&#xB7;lil&#x2B9; </em>of Scripture was the flute.The flute was one of the most popular of all musical instruments, being played at joyous times such as banquets and weddings (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001538/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 5:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001538/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 30:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001538/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 1:40</a>), a custom imitated by children in public places.
