In certain texts, however, either the context or a modifying word indicates that an aromatic plant is referred to, and <em>qa&#xB7;neh&#x2B9; </em>is thus translated &#x201C;calamus&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:23</a>) and &#x201C;cane.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 4:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 43:24</a>.Among the ingredients used in preparing the holy anointing oil was &#x201C;sweet calamus,&#x201D; the sweetness referring to its odor, not its taste. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:22-25</a>) The <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Song of Solomon (4:14</a>) includes &#x201C;cane&#x201D; among other odoriferous spices. Jehovah through his prophet <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah (43:24</a>) reproved the sinful Israelites for &#x2018;having bought&#x2019; (Heb., <em>qa&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;tha</em>) for his temple service no &#x201C;[sweet] cane&#x201D; (<em>qa&#xB7;neh&#x2B9;</em>), thereby making a play on words in Hebrew. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah (6:20</a>) refers to cane received from a &#x201C;land far away,&#x201D; while <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel (27:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;19</a>) includes cane among the products for which wealthy Tyre traded.The English word &#x201C;calamus&#x201D; is derived from the Greek <em>ka&#x2B9;la&#xB7;mos, </em>used by the translators of the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>to render the Hebrew <em>qa&#xB7;neh&#x2B9;. </em>Like the Hebrew word, <em>ka&#x2B9;la&#xB7;mos </em>also has the basic meaning of reed or cane, whereas the English word &#x201C;calamus&#x201D; today is used principally to refer to the sweet flag (<em>Acorus calamus</em>) or its aromatic root.Regarding the sweet cane, or calamus, of the Hebrew Scriptures, many scholars prefer to identify it with an aromatic reed grass of India, such as <em>Cymbopogon martini, </em>a perennial grass whose leaves when crushed produce a fragrant oil known as ginger-grass oil. Other varieties of these Indian grasses produce citronella oil and lemongrass oil. The view that one or more of such sweet-scented grasses is represented by the sweet cane, or calamus, is based mainly on Jeremiah&#x2019;s reference to the product as coming from a &#x201C;land far away,&#x201D; which in this case would be India. Other areas, however, may have been producers of the aromatic cane, or calamus, as is indicated by Ezekiel&#x2019;s prophecy (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000861/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">27:19</a>). Thus, while some kind of aromatic reed or cane is meant, the plant&#x2019;s precise identification remains uncertain."}
