(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002114/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 27:33</a>) Hushai, with his robe ripped and dirt on his head, met the fleeing king on the Mount of Olives. He followed David&#x2019;s suggestion that he go back into the city, feign loyalty to Absalom, endeavor to frustrate Ahithophel&#x2019;s counsel, and keep David informed through the priests Zadok and Abiathar.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002114/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 16:16-19</a>) When Absalom called for Hushai&#x2019;s opinion concerning the best military strategy, Hushai spoke contrary to Ahithophel and recommended a course that would in fact allow David time to get organized. Hushai presented his idea in a way that made it appear better to Absalom and his associates than Ahithophel&#x2019;s advice to attack immediately. Hushai then informed the priests of what had happened.
