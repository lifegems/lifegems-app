At the time of Paul&#x2019;s first imprisonment, Epaphras came to Rome, bringing an encouraging report in regard to the love and steadfastness of the Colossian congregation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001379/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Col 1:4-8</a>) Evidently he remained in Rome, at least for a time, since Paul, in writing his letter to the Colossians, includes Epaphras&#x2019; greetings and assures them that this slave of Jesus Christ always exerts himself &#x201C;in your behalf in his prayers, that you may finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God.&#x201D; As testified by Paul, this beloved fellow slave also put forth great effort in behalf of the brothers in Laodicea and Hierapolis. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001379/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Col 4:12,&#xA0;13</a>) Then, too, in writing to Philemon, Paul conveys the greetings of Epaphras and refers to him as &#x201C;my fellow captive in union with Christ.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001379/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Phm&#xA0;23</a>) Epaphras is not to be confused with Epaphroditus from Philippi."}
