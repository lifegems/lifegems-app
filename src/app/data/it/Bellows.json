For giving furnaces a forced draft, the bellows are more efficient than mere fanning, or the antiquated lung-powered hollow reeds and blowtubes also used for this purpose. The construction of bellows was simple: A bag mounted on a frame or base was attached to a tube leading to the furnace, which tube may have been of iron, or reed tipped with fire-resistant clay. Hand-operated bellows were useful for small forges; but for large high-temperature furnaces, dual foot-powered bellows were employed, one under each foot of the operator, who pumped down alternately, first one foot and then the other, each time pulling a cord to refill the compressed one. To give these big furnaces a constant draft, two men worked two pairs of bellows. The Hebrew word for bellows is <em>map&#xB7;pu&#x2B9;ach, </em>which comes from the root <em>na&#xB7;phach&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;blow.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000626/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:7</a>) This instrument is specifically mentioned only once in the Scriptures (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000626/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 6:29</a>), though perhaps alluded to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000626/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 54:16</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000626/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 22:20,&#xA0;21</a>.
