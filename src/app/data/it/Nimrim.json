(See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003258/0\">BETH-NIMRAH</a>.) The order in which places are named in the prophecies, however, seems to indicate <span id=\"page503\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"503\" data-before-text=\"503\"></span>a location in the S of Moab. Thus many prefer identification with the Wadi en-Numeirah, which flows down into the SE end of the Dead Sea about 17&#xA0;km (11&#xA0;mi) WSW of Karak. The prophecies foretell that these waters will become &#x201C;mere desolations,&#x201D; either in a figurative sense because of the desolating of the land or perhaps because of a damming up of their streams by enemy forces."}
