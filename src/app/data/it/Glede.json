Four Hebrew manuscripts, and also the Samaritan <em>Pentateuch </em>and the Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>omit <em>dai&#xB7;yah&#x2B9; </em>at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001720/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 14:13</a>. Some scholars believe that it may be a scribal correction originally placed in the margin but which eventually was introduced into the text itself. However, the plural form (<em>dai&#xB7;yohth&#x2B9;</em>) appears at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001720/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 34:15</a> as describing birds gathered at the ruins of Edom following its desolation.The identification of this bird is uncertain. It is suggested that the Hebrew name is derived from the verb meaning &#x201C;pounce&#x201D; or &#x201C;come darting.&#x201D; &#x201C;Glede&#x201D; is a suitable translation, since it is a term variously applied to any of several birds of prey, though especially to the red kite (<em>Milvus milvus</em>). Most modern scholars relate the Hebrew <em>dai&#xB7;yah&#x2B9; </em>to the kite, there being more than one variety of this bird found in Palestine.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001720/0\">KITE</a>."}
