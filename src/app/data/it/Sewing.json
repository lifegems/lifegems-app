From earliest times sewing, including embroidery, has played a prominent part in mankind&#x2019;s activities. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 26:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 35:35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Job 16:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Ec 3:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> Eze 13:18</a>) The first man and woman, Adam and Eve, &#x201C;sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:7</a>) This may simply mean that they fastened the large fig leaves together, using twigs of the fig tree to do so.When explaining why his disciples did not fast as did the Pharisees and John&#x2019;s disciples, Christ Jesus pointed out that sewing a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment would worsen the tear. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 2:18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;21</a>) When washed, the patch would shrink and, in the process, pull away from the old garment, ripping it. This illustration should have helped those hearing Jesus&#x2019; words to see that it was now time for them to become his followers and that it was wrong for them to try to impose their practices on Jesus&#x2019; disciples. John himself had earlier explained that his work was preparatory for Christ&#x2019;s coming and, therefore, was of a temporary nature.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003916/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:27-30</a>."}
