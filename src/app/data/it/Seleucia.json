The two sites were connected by road; and the navigable Orontes River, which flowed past Antioch, emptied into the Mediterranean Sea a short distance S of Seleucia. Accompanied by Barnabas, Paul sailed from Seleucia at the start of his first missionary journey, in about 47&#xA0;C.E. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003889/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 13:4</a>) Though thereafter unnamed in the Acts account, Seleucia likely figured in events narrated therein.

It was just N of modern-day S&#xFC;veydiye, or Samandag, in Turkey. Silt from the Orontes has converted ancient Seleucia&#x2019;s harbor into a marsh."}
