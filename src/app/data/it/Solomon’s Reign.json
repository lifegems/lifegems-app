During his royal rule Israel reached its pinnacle of wealth and glory. Solomon was both a wise king and a master organizer. He built a magnificent temple to Jehovah, various government buildings, and a royal palace, as depicted below. He established administrative districts that, on a rotational basis, provided the royal household with a variety of food, regardless of the season.Solomon&#x2019;s rule was a time of genuine peace and security. This well foreshadows the peaceful reign of the Messiah, who &#x201C;will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River [Euphrates] to the ends of the earth.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001396/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 72:8</a>.<strong>[Map on page&#xA0;748]</strong>(For fully formatted text, see publication)<strong>Domain of SOLOMON</strong><em>Great Sea</em><em>Euphrates River</em>TiphsahHamathTadmorDamascusTyreDanGibeonJerusalem1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12GazaBeer-sheba<em>T.V. of Egypt</em>Ezion-geberArea in Subjection to SolomonAdministrative Districts<span id=\"page749\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"749\" data-before-text=\"749\"></span><strong>[Pictures on page&#xA0;749]</strong>During Solomon&#x2019;s reign, Judah and Israel dwelt in security<wbr>&#x2014;figuratively speaking, everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001396/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:25</a>)Even rulers of other lands came to hear his wisdom (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001396/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001396/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:1</a>)"}
