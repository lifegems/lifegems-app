In the Bible it relates primarily, though not exclusively, to Jehovah God the Creator and his purposes. Foreordination means the ordaining, decreeing, or determining of something beforehand; or the quality or state of being foreordained.<strong>Original-Language Words. </strong>The words generally translated as &#x201C;foreknow,&#x201D; &#x201C;foreknowledge,&#x201D; and &#x201C;foreordain&#x201D; are found in the Christian Greek Scriptures, although the same basic ideas are expressed in the Hebrew Scriptures.&#x201C;Foreknowledge&#x201D; translates the Greek <em>pro&#x2B9;gno&#xB7;sis </em>(from <em>pro, </em>before, and <em>gno&#x2B9;sis, </em>knowledge). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 1:2</a>) The related verb <em>pro&#xB7;gi&#xB7;no&#x2B9;sko </em>is used in two cases with regard to humans: in Paul&#x2019;s statement that certain Jews were &#x201C;previously acquainted&#x201D; with him (knew him beforehand), and in Peter&#x2019;s reference to the &#x201C;advance knowledge&#x201D; had by those addressed in his second letter. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 26:4,&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Pe 3:17</a>) In this latter case it is obvious that such foreknowledge was not infinite; that is, it did not mean that those Christians knew <em>all </em>the details of time, place, and circumstance about the future events and conditions Peter had discussed. But they did have a <em>general </em>outline of what to expect, received as a result of God&#x2019;s inspiration of Peter and of other contributors to the Bible.&#x201C;Foreordain&#x201D; translates the Greek <em>pro&#xB7;o&#xB7;ri&#x2B9;zo </em>(from <em>pro, </em>before, and <em>ho&#xB7;ri&#x2B9;zo, </em>mark out or set the bounds). (The English word &#x201C;horizon&#x201D; transliterates the Greek word <em>ho&#xB7;ri&#x2B9;zon, </em>meaning the &#x201C;bounding&#x201D; or &#x201C;limiting.&#x201D;) Illustrating the sense of the Greek verb <em>ho&#xB7;ri&#x2B9;zo </em>is Jesus Christ&#x2019;s statement that, as &#x201C;the Son of man,&#x201D; he was &#x201C;going his way according to what [was] marked out [<em>ho&#xB7;ri&#xB7;sme&#x2B9;non</em>].&#x201D; Paul said that God had &#x201C;decreed [marked out, <em>ho&#xB7;ri&#x2B9;sas</em>] the appointed times and the set limits of the dwelling of men.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 22:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 17:26</a>) The same verb is used of human determination, as when the disciples &#x201C;determined [<em>ho&#x2B9;ri&#xB7;san</em>]&#x201D; to send relief to their needy brothers. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 11:29</a>) However, specific references to <em>fore</em>ordaining in the Christian Greek Scriptures are applied only to God.<span id=\"page852\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"852\" data-before-text=\"852\"></span><strong>Factors to Recognize. </strong>To understand the matter of foreknowledge and foreordination as relating to God, certain factors necessarily must be recognized.First, God&#x2019;s ability to foreknow and foreordain is clearly stated in the Bible. Jehovah himself sets forth as proof of his Godship this ability to foreknow and foreordain events of salvation and deliverance, as well as acts of judgment and punishment, and then to bring such events to fulfillment. His chosen people are witnesses of these facts. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 44:6-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 48:3-8</a>) Such divine foreknowledge and foreordination form the basis for all true prophecy. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 42:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 50:45;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> Am 3:7,&#xA0;8</a>) God challenges the nations opposing his people to furnish proof of the godship they claim for their mighty ones and their idol-gods, calling on them to do so by foretelling similar acts of salvation or judgment and then bringing them to pass. Their impotence in this respect demonstrates their idols to be &#x2018;mere wind and unreality.&#x2019;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 41:1-10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 21-29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 43:9-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/6/3\" data-bid=\"7-4\" class=\"b\"> 45:20,&#xA0;21</a>.A second factor to be considered is the free moral agency of God&#x2019;s intelligent creatures. The Scriptures show that God extends to such creatures the privilege and responsibility of free choice, of exercising free moral agency (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">De 30:19, 20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Jos 24:15</a>), thereby making them accountable for their acts. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:16, 17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:11-19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> Ro 14:10-12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/8/3\" data-bid=\"9-4\" class=\"b\"> Heb 4:13</a>) They are thus not mere automatons, or robots. Man could not truly have been created in &#x201C;God&#x2019;s image&#x201D; if he were not a free moral agent. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:26, 27</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/0\">FREEDOM</a>.) Logically, there should be no conflict between God&#x2019;s foreknowledge (as well as his foreordaining) and the free moral agency of his intelligent creatures.A third factor that must be considered, one sometimes overlooked, is that of God&#x2019;s moral standards and qualities, including his justice, honesty, impartiality, love, mercy, and kindness. Any understanding of God&#x2019;s use of the powers of foreknowledge and foreordination must therefore harmonize with not only some of these factors but with all of them. Clearly, whatever God foreknows must inevitably come to pass, so that God is able to call &#x201C;things that are not as though they were.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 4:17</a>.<strong><em>Does God know in advance everything that people will do?</em></strong>The question then arises: Is his exercise of foreknowledge infinite, without limit? Does he foresee and foreknow all future actions of all his creatures, spirit and human? And does he foreordain such actions or even predestinate what shall be the final destiny of all his creatures, even doing so before they have come into existence?Or, is God&#x2019;s exercise of foreknowledge selective and discretionary, so that whatever he chooses to foresee and foreknow, he does, but what he does not choose to foresee or foreknow, he does not? And, instead of preceding their existence, does God&#x2019;s determination of his creatures&#x2019; eternal destiny await his judgment of their course of life and of their proved attitude under test? The answers to these questions must necessarily come from the Scriptures themselves and the information they provide concerning God&#x2019;s actions and dealings with his creatures, including what has been revealed through his Son, Christ Jesus.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 2:16</a>.<strong><em>Predestinarian view. </em></strong>The view that God&#x2019;s exercise of his foreknowledge is infinite and that he does foreordain the course and destiny of all individuals is known as predestinarianism. Its advocates reason that God&#x2019;s divinity and perfection require that he be omniscient (all-knowing), not only respecting the past and present but also regarding the future. According to this concept, for him not to foreknow all matters in their minutest detail would evidence imperfection. Examples such as the case of Isaac&#x2019;s twin sons, Esau and Jacob, are presented as evidence of God&#x2019;s foreordaining creatures before their birth (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 9:10-13</a>); and texts such as <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ephesians 1:4, 5</a> are cited as evidence that God foreknew and foreordained the future of all his creatures even before the start of creation.To be correct, this view would, of course, have to harmonize with all the factors previously mentioned, including the Scriptural presentation of God&#x2019;s qualities, standards, and purposes, as well as his righteous ways in dealing with his creatures. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Re 15:3,&#xA0;4</a>) We may properly consider, then, the implications of such a predestinarian view.This concept would mean that, prior to creating angels or earthling man, God exercised his powers of foreknowledge and foresaw and foreknew all that would result from such creation, including the rebellion of one of his spirit sons, the subsequent rebellion of the first human pair in Eden (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:1-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 8:44</a>), and all the bad consequences of such rebellion down to and beyond this present day. This would necessarily mean that all the wickedness that history has <span id=\"page853\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"853\" data-before-text=\"853\"></span>recorded (the crime and immorality, oppression and resultant suffering, lying and hypocrisy, false worship and idolatry) once existed, before creation&#x2019;s beginning, only in the mind of God, in the form of his foreknowledge of the future in all of its minutest details.If the Creator of mankind had indeed exercised his power to foreknow all that history has seen since man&#x2019;s creation, then the full weight of all the wickedness thereafter resulting was deliberately set in motion by God when he spoke the words: &#x201C;Let us make man.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:26</a>) These facts bring into question the reasonableness and consistency of the predestinarian concept; particularly so, since the disciple James shows that disorder and other vile things do not originate from God&#x2019;s heavenly presence but are &#x201C;earthly, animal, demonic&#x201D; in source.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 3:14-18</a>.<strong><em>Infinite exercise of foreknowledge? </em></strong>The argument that God&#x2019;s not foreknowing all future events and circumstances in full detail would evidence imperfection on his part is, in reality, an arbitrary view of perfection. Perfection, correctly defined, does not demand such an absolute, all-embracing extension, inasmuch as the perfection of anything actually depends upon its measuring up completely to the standards of excellence set by one qualified to judge its merits. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/1\">PERFECTION</a>.) Ultimately, God&#x2019;s own will and good pleasure, not human opinions or concepts, are the deciding factors as to whether anything is perfect.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">De 32:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 22:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/18/2\" data-bid=\"19-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 46:10</a>.To illustrate this, God&#x2019;s almightiness is undeniably perfect and is infinite in capacity. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 29:11, 12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> Job 36:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> 37:23</a>) Yet his perfection in strength does not require him to use his power to the full extent of his omnipotence in any or in all cases. Clearly he has not done so; if he had, not merely certain ancient cities and some nations would have been destroyed, but the earth and all in it would have been obliterated long ago by God&#x2019;s executions of judgment, accompanied by mighty expressions of disapproval and wrath, as at the Flood and on other occasions. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 6:5-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:23-25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> 29</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 9:13-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/21/1\" data-bid=\"22-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 30:23,&#xA0;24</a>.) God&#x2019;s exercise of his might is therefore not simply an unleashing of limitless power but is constantly governed by his purpose and, where merited, tempered by his mercy.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 9:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 78:38, 39;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/22/2\" data-bid=\"23-3\" class=\"b\"> Jer 30:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/22/3\" data-bid=\"23-4\" class=\"b\"> La 3:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/22/4\" data-bid=\"23-5\" class=\"b\"> Eze 20:17</a>.Similarly, if, in certain respects, God chooses to exercise his infinite ability of foreknowledge in a selective way and to the degree that pleases him, then assuredly no human or angel can rightly say: &#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Job 9:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 45:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/23/2\" data-bid=\"24-3\" class=\"b\"> Da 4:35</a>) It is therefore not a question of ability, what God <em>can </em>foresee, foreknow, and foreordain, for &#x201C;with God all things are possible.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 19:26</a>) The question is what God <em>sees fit </em>to foresee, foreknow, and foreordain, for &#x201C;everything that he delighted to do he has done.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 115:3</a>.<strong><em>Selective exercise of foreknowledge. </em></strong>The alternative to predestinarianism, the selective or discretionary exercise of God&#x2019;s powers of foreknowledge, would have to harmonize with God&#x2019;s own righteous standards and be consistent with what he reveals of himself in his Word. In contrast with the theory of predestinarianism, a number of texts point to an examination by God of a situation then current and a decision made on the basis of such examination.Thus, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 11:5-8</a> God is described as directing his attention earthward, surveying the situation at Babel, and, at that time, determining the action to be taken to break up the unrighteous project there. After wickedness developed at Sodom and Gomorrah, Jehovah advised Abraham of his decision to investigate (by means of his angels) to &#x201C;see whether they act altogether according to the outcry over it that has come to me, and, if not, <em>I can get to know it.&#x201D; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 18:20-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:1</a>) God spoke of &#x2018;becoming acquainted with Abraham,&#x2019; and after Abraham went to the point of attempting to sacrifice Isaac, Jehovah said, &#x201C;For <em>now I do know </em>that you are God-fearing in that you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 18:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/28/1\" data-bid=\"29-2\" class=\"b\"> 22:11, 12</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 9:7,&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/29/1\" data-bid=\"30-2\" class=\"b\"> Ga 4:9</a>.Selective foreknowledge means that God could choose <em>not </em>to foreknow indiscriminately all the future acts of his creatures. This would mean that, rather than all history from creation onward being a mere rerun of what had already been foreseen and foreordained, God could with all sincerity set before the first human pair the prospect of everlasting life in an earth free from wickedness. His instructions to his first human son and daughter to act as his perfect and sinless agents in filling the earth with their offspring and making it a paradise, as well as exercising control over the animal creation, could thus be expressed as the grant of a truly loving privilege and as his genuine desire toward them<wbr>&#x2014;not merely as the giving of a commission that, on their part, was foredoomed to failure. God&#x2019;s arranging for a test by means of &#x201C;the tree of the knowledge of good and bad&#x201D; and his creation of <span id=\"page854\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"854\" data-before-text=\"854\"></span>&#x201C;the tree of life&#x201D; in the garden of Eden also would not be meaningless or cynical acts, made so by his foreknowing that the human pair would sin and never be able to eat of &#x201C;the tree of life.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/30/1\" data-bid=\"31-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:7-9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/30/2\" data-bid=\"31-3\" class=\"b\"> 15-17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/30/3\" data-bid=\"31-4\" class=\"b\"> 3:22-24</a>.To offer something very desirable to another person on conditions known beforehand to be unreachable is recognized as both hypocritical and cruel. The prospect of everlasting life is presented in God&#x2019;s Word as a goal for all persons, one possible to attain. After urging his listeners to &#x2018;keep on asking and seeking&#x2019; good things from God, Jesus pointed out that a father does not give a stone or a serpent to his child that asks for bread or a fish. Showing his Father&#x2019;s view of disappointing the legitimate hopes of a person, Jesus then said: &#x201C;Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:7-11</a>.Thus, the invitations and opportunities to receive benefits and everlasting blessings set before all men by God are bona fide. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 21:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/32/1\" data-bid=\"33-2\" class=\"b\"> Jas 1:5,&#xA0;6</a>) He can in all sincerity urge men to &#x2018;turn back from transgression and keep living,&#x2019; as he did with the people of Israel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 18:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\"> 30-32</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 29:11,&#xA0;12</a>.) Logically, he could not do this if he foreknew that they were individually destined to die in wickedness.

However, such foreknowledge or foreordination does not deprive the individuals within such collective groups or divisions of mankind of exercising free choice as to the particular course they will follow. This can be seen from the following examples:Prior to the Flood of Noah&#x2019;s day, Jehovah announced his purpose to bring about this act of destruction, resulting in loss of human as well as animal life. The Biblical account shows, however, that such divine determination was made after the conditions developed that called for such action, including violence and other badness. Additionally, God, who is able to &#x201C;know the heart of the sons of mankind,&#x201D; made examination and found that &#x201C;every inclination of the thoughts of [mankind&#x2019;s] heart was only bad all the time.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 6:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/56/1\" data-bid=\"57-2\" class=\"b\"> Ge 6:5</a>) Yet <em>individuals, </em>Noah and his family, gained God&#x2019;s favor and escaped destruction.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 6:7,&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/57/1\" data-bid=\"58-2\" class=\"b\"> 7:1</a>.Similarly, although God gave the nation of Israel the opportunity to become &#x201C;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&#x201D; by keeping his covenant, yet some 40 years later, when the nation was at the borders of the Promised Land, Jehovah foretold that they would break his covenant and, as a nation, would be forsaken by him. This foreknowledge was not without prior basis, however, as national insubordination and rebellion already had been revealed.

These include Esau and Jacob (mentioned earlier), the Pharaoh of the Exodus, Samson, Solomon, Josiah, Jeremiah, Cyrus, John the Baptizer, Judas Iscariot, and God&#x2019;s own Son Jesus.In the cases of Samson, Jeremiah, and John the Baptizer, Jehovah exercised foreknowledge prior to their birth. This foreknowledge, however, did not specify what their final destiny would be. Rather, on the basis of such foreknowledge, Jehovah foreordained that Samson should live according to the Nazirite vow and should initiate the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines, that Jeremiah should serve as a prophet, and that John the Baptizer should do a preparatory work as a forerunner of the Messiah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/70/0\" data-bid=\"71-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 13:3-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/70/1\" data-bid=\"71-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 1:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/70/2\" data-bid=\"71-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 1:13-17</a>) While highly favored by such privileges, this did not guarantee their gaining eternal salvation or even that they would remain faithful until death (although all three did). Thus, Jehovah foretold that one of David&#x2019;s many sons would be named Solomon and he foreordained that Solomon would be used to build the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/71/0\" data-bid=\"72-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 7:12, 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/71/1\" data-bid=\"72-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 6:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/71/2\" data-bid=\"72-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 22:6-19</a>) However, though favored in this way and even privileged to write certain books of the Holy Scriptures, Solomon nevertheless fell into apostasy in his later years.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/72/0\" data-bid=\"73-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 11:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/72/1\" data-bid=\"73-2\" class=\"b\"> 9-11</a>.Likewise with Esau and Jacob, God&#x2019;s foreknowledge did not fix their eternal destinies but, rather, determined, or foreordained, which of the national groups descending from the two sons would gain a dominant position over the other. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/73/0\" data-bid=\"74-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 25:23-26</a>) This foreseen dominance also pointed to the gaining of the right of the firstborn by Jacob, a right that brought along with it the privilege of being in the line of descent through which the Abrahamic &#x201C;seed&#x201D; would come.

Nor are divinely assigned privileges to be dispensed solely on the basis of works, which might allow a person to feel he has &#x2018;earned the right&#x2019; to such privileges and that they are &#x2018;owed to him.&#x2019; The apostle Paul stressed this point in showing why God, by undeserved kindness, could grant to the Gentile nations privileges once seemingly reserved for Israel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/75/0\" data-bid=\"76-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 9:1-6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/75/1\" data-bid=\"76-2\" class=\"b\"> 10-13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/75/2\" data-bid=\"76-3\" class=\"b\"> 30-32</a>.Paul&#x2019;s quotations concerning Jehovah&#x2019;s &#x2018;love for Jacob [Israel] and his hatred for Esau [Edom]&#x2019; comes from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/76/0\" data-bid=\"77-1\" class=\"b\">Malachi 1:2, 3</a>, written long after Jacob and Esau&#x2019;s time. So the Bible does not necessarily say that Jehovah held such opinion of the twins before their birth. It is a scientifically established fact that much of a child&#x2019;s general disposition and temperament is determined at the time of conception because of the genetic factors contributed by each parent. That God can see such factors is self-evident; David speaks of Jehovah as seeing &#x201C;even the embryo of me.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/77/0\" data-bid=\"78-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 139:14-16</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/78/0\" data-bid=\"79-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 11:5</a>.) To what extent such divine insight affected Jehovah&#x2019;s foreordination concerning the two boys cannot be said, but at any rate, his choice of Jacob over Esau did not of itself doom Esau or his descendants, the Edomites, to destruction. Even individuals from among the accursed Canaanites gained the privilege of association with God&#x2019;s covenant people and received blessings.

The &#x201C;change of mind&#x201D; that Esau earnestly sought with tears, however, was only an unsuccessful attempt to change his father Isaac&#x2019;s decision that the firstborn&#x2019;s special blessing should remain entirely with Jacob. Hence, this indicated no repentance before God on Esau&#x2019;s part as to his materialistic attitude.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/80/0\" data-bid=\"81-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 27:32-34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/80/1\" data-bid=\"81-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 12:16,&#xA0;17</a>.Jehovah&#x2019;s prophecy concerning Josiah called for some descendant of David to be so named, and it foretold his acting against false worship in the city of Bethel.

Nor is there any indication that God coerced the individuals to act against their own will. In the cases of Pharaoh, Judas Iscariot, and God&#x2019;s own Son, there is no evidence that Jehovah&#x2019;s foreknowledge was exercised prior to the person&#x2019;s coming into existence. Within these individual cases certain principles are illustrated, bearing on God&#x2019;s foreknowledge and foreordination.One such principle is God&#x2019;s testing of individuals by causing or allowing certain circumstances or events, or by causing such individuals to hear his inspired messages, the result being that they are obliged to exercise their free choice to make a decision and thus reveal a definite heart attitude, read by Jehovah.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/92/0\" data-bid=\"93-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 9:14-18</a>) Likewise, according to many translations, God advised Moses that he would &#x201C;harden [Pharaoh&#x2019;s] heart.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/93/0\" data-bid=\"94-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 4:21</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/94/0\" data-bid=\"95-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 9:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/94/1\" data-bid=\"95-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/94/2\" data-bid=\"95-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;27</a>.)

After quoting Hebrew scholars M.&#xA0;M.&#xA0;Kalisch, H.&#xA0;F.&#xA0;W.&#xA0;Gesenius, and B.&#xA0;Davies in support, Rotherham states that the Hebrew sense of the texts involving Pharaoh is that &#x201C;God permitted Pharaoh to harden his own heart<wbr>&#x2014;spared him&#x2014;<wbr>gave him the opportunity, the occasion, of working out the wickedness that was in him. That is all.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Emphasised Bible, </em>appendix, p.&#xA0;919; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/96/0\" data-bid=\"97-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 10:5-7</a>.Corroborating this understanding is the fact that the record definitely shows that Pharaoh himself &#x201C;hardened his heart.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/97/0\" data-bid=\"98-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 8:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/97/1\" data-bid=\"98-2\" class=\"b\"> 32</a>, <em>KJ; </em>&#x201C;made his heart unresponsive,&#x201D; <em>NW</em>) He thus exercised his own will and followed his own stubborn inclination, the results of which inclination Jehovah accurately foresaw and predicted. The repeated opportunities given him by Jehovah obliged Pharaoh to make decisions, and in doing so he became hardened in his attitude.

The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but they did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God&#x2019;s having foreordained Judas&#x2019; actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: &#x201C;Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/102/0\" data-bid=\"103-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 5:22</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/103/0\" data-bid=\"104-1\" class=\"b\">3:6</a>.) Evidencing his <span id=\"page858\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"858\" data-before-text=\"858\"></span>concern that the selection of his 12 apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision.

He allowed a &#x2018;poisonous root to spring up&#x2019; and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God&#x2019;s direction, but the Devil&#x2019;s leading in a course of thievery and treachery.

Grecian mythology represented the control of men&#x2019;s destiny by three goddesses: <em>Clotho </em>(spinner), who spun the thread of life; <em>Lachesis </em>(disposer of lots), who determined the length of life; and <em>Atropos </em>(inflexible), who cut life off when the time expired. A similar triad was found among the Roman deities.According to Jewish historian Josephus (first century C.E.), the Pharisees endeavored to harmonize the idea of fate with their belief in God and with the free moral agency granted to man.
