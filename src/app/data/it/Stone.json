Its durable nature has been of great aid to archaeologists in gaining some knowledge of the past. Temples, palaces, monuments, and other structures of stone were erected by the Egyptians, Assyrians, and other nations. On many of these structures are pictorial representations and inscriptions relating events, describing victories, and depicting customs, which throw light on their history as well as on their everyday life. The Hebrews used stone widely in buildings (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Le 14:40,&#xA0;41</a>), walls (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 4:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 24:31</a>), altars (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 20:25</a>), millstones (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 9:53</a>), water vessels (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 2:6</a>), weights (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 16:11</a>), for covering wells, caves, and tombs (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 29:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Jos 10:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 11:38</a>), as well as for many other purposes. However, the Hebrews did not erect monuments with pictorial bas-reliefs, as did the pagan nations; consequently little is known about their appearance, the exact styles of their clothing, and so forth. But the Bible provides a richer history of Israel, their manner of life, and their personalities than do the stone remains of any of the other nations.Stonecutting was a highly developed craft.

White pebbles were used for pronouncing innocence, acquittal; black ones for pronouncing guilt, condemnation. The white pebble given to the conqueror therefore appears to mean Jesus&#x2019; judgment of him as innocent, pure, clean, passing Christ&#x2019;s approval as a disciple.See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/1\">JEWELS AND PRECIOUS STONES</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004235/2\">ROCK-MASS</a>."}
