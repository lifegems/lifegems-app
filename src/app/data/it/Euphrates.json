(<em>RS </em>reads, &#x201C;as far as the entrance of the desert this side of the Euphrates&#x201D;; <em>JB, </em>&#x201C;to the beginning of the desert that ends at the river Euphrates.&#x201D;) It thus appears that Jehovah&#x2019;s promise was first fully realized during the reigns of David and Solomon when the boundaries of Israel&#x2019;s dominion extended to include the Aramaean kingdom of Zobah and thus reached to the banks of the Euphrates, evidently along the section traversing northern Syria.

One, known as the Kara Su, takes its rise in NE Turkey about 100&#xA0;km (60&#xA0;mi) from the SE corner of the Black Sea. The other, the Murat Nehri, has its headwaters originating about midway between Lake Van and Mount Ararat. Approximately halfway between the two rivers lies the valley of the Araks River, thought by some to be related to the Gihon River of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 2:13</a>. The courses of the Kara Su and the Murat Nehri run fairly parallel in a westerly direction until they unite near the city of Keban, at an elevation of about 610&#xA0;m (2,000&#xA0;ft) above sea level.From this point on, the combined streams form the Euphrates proper. Having already traversed some 640&#xA0;km (400&#xA0;mi) of mountainous terrain from the initial headwaters of the Murat Nehri, the river now turns southward for a distance of some 480&#xA0;km (300&#xA0;mi), during which its flow is broken by various cataracts and rapids, until it finally emerges on the Syrian plain near the site of ancient Carchemish.<strong><em>Ford at Carchemish. </em></strong>Carchemish guarded the principal fording place used by armies or caravans crossing from N Mesopotamia into N Syria. Carchemish was a major fortress city that later came under Assyrian control. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 10:5-9</a>) Pharaoh Nechoh took the city about 629&#xA0;B.C.E., engaging Josiah&#x2019;s army at Megiddo and killing that Judean king while on the way there.

The &#x201C;middle&#x201D; section of the Euphrates reaches from Carchemish down to the city of Hit, in the region of bitumen pits, its flow being strengthened by the waters of the Balikh and Khabur rivers. Below Hit the river courses through the fertile Mesopotamian plain, and some 80&#xA0;km (50&#xA0;mi) below Hit, in the neighborhood of Baghdad, it draws within 40&#xA0;km (25&#xA0;mi) of the Tigris River. In this lower section of the Euphrates, the river dissipates itself in the extensive marshes and in the ruined canals, and its flow becomes sluggish.The Euphrates and the Tigris finally unite near Basra, and from this junction to the Persian Gulf the stream is known as the Shatt-al-Arab. According to Pliny and other ancient historians, the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris. (<em>Natural History, </em>VI, XXVI, 128-131) It is generally believed that the silt deposited by the two rivers has built up the delta region at the head of the Persian Gulf and that the original coastline extended much farther N, perhaps reaching as far as the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldeans, Abraham&#x2019;s early home.The Euphrates&#x2019; waters reach their lowest point in September and then steadily rise until May, when their normal crest is reached. Because of the melting snows, spring floods occur. The annual overflowing of both the Euphrates and the Tigris doubtless is the basis for Isaiah&#x2019;s description of Babylonia as &#x201C;the wilderness of the sea.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 21:1,&#xA0;2</a>) This flooding was controlled in ancient times by dikes and sluices that diverted the waters into irrigation canals and into catch basins. These canals formed an irrigation network between the Euphrates and the Tigris that ensured productiveness for most of lower Babylonia. Over the centuries the canals generally have become blocked up and clogged, with resultant agricultural deterioration; the accumulation of salts in the soil because of the irrigation waters also contributed to the gradual ruin of the once-fertile valley.<strong>Major Cities. </strong>Along the Euphrates&#x2019; banks lay many ancient cities, including Ur, Erech, Kish, and Babylon. The river&#x2019;s course has apparently shifted somewhat to the W so that most of the ancient sites now lie several miles to the E of it.The great city of Babylon was originally built so that it straddled the Euphrates, and the river&#x2019;s waters were used to form a broad deep moat encircling the city and also to form a network of canals within the city walls. At the time of Babylon&#x2019;s fall in 539&#xA0;B.C.E., Cyrus diverted the waters of the Euphrates so that his troops could march through the riverbed into the unsuspecting city. Thus, the waters of the Euphrates were &#x2018;dried up.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 44:27, 28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 45:1</a>) In symbol, the same thing is prophesied to result from the outpouring of the sixth angel&#x2019;s &#x201C;bowl&#x201D; on &#x201C;the great river Euphrates,&#x201D; as described at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 16:12</a>.

A translation by the Jewish Publication Society here simply transliterates the Hebrew word as &#x201C;Perath,&#x201D; and some suggest that the reference is not to the Euphrates but to the town of Parah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 18:23</a>), near Anathoth, a few miles from Jerusalem. However, the repetition of the name <em>Perath&#x2B9; </em>(Euphrates) four times in the account evidently shows that the place named had a significant relation to the prophetic picture being enacted, whereas the obscure village of Parah would hardly seem to give particular significance to the event. Though some point out that the Hebrew word <em>na&#xB7;har&#x2B9; </em>(river) is not used in connection with <em>Perath&#x2B9; </em>in this text, it may be noted that it is likewise lacking at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 51:63</a>, yet the reference there obviously is to the Euphrates River. Hence, there seems to be no good reason for assuming that the account at <span id=\"page770\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"770\" data-before-text=\"770\"></span><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 13:1-7</a> refers to anything other than the Euphrates River.It is quite possible that Jeremiah&#x2019;s hiding of the belt near the river took place at least in the general region of the crossing of the Euphrates by the Babylonian armies under Nebuchadnezzar in their march that eventually led to the desolation of Judah and Jerusalem. At any rate, the trip, or possibly two trips, to the Euphrates by Jeremiah certainly should have given impressive weight to the warning message this action was to convey to the spiritually corrupt people of the kingdom of Judah.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001446/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 2:18,&#xA0;19</a>."}
