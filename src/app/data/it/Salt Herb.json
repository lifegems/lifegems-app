(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003812/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 30:4</a>) The original-language word is considered to be derived from a root meaning &#x201C;salt,&#x201D; and it has also been translated &#x201C;salt-wort&#x201D; (<em>AS, AT, Da</em>), &#x201C;cress&#x201D; (<em>Fn</em>), &#x201C;grass&#x201D; (<em>Dy</em>), and &#x201C;mallow(s)&#x201D; (<em>KJ, Le, RS</em>). The rendering &#x201C;mallows&#x201D; appears to have resulted from the similarity between the Hebrew word <em>mal&#xB7;lu&#x2B9;ach </em>and the Greek word <em>mo&#xB7;lo&#x2B9;khe, </em>which is believed to be related to the English designation &#x201C;mallow.&#x201D; However, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003812/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job 30:4</a> the translators of the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>did not use <em>mo&#xB7;lo&#x2B9;khe </em>but <em>ha&#x2B9;li&#xB7;ma </em>(&#x201C;salt herbs,&#x201D; <em>LXX, </em>Bagster), and <em>ha&#x2B9;li&#xB7;ma, </em>like <em>mal&#xB7;lu&#x2B9;ach, </em>is thought to refer either to the salty taste of the plant or to the region where it grows.The plant most frequently suggested as corresponding to the <em>mal&#xB7;lu&#x2B9;ach </em>of the Bible is sea purslane or shrubby orache (<em>Atriplex halimus</em>). Ordinarily this bushy shrub grows 1 to 2&#xA0;m (3 to 6.5&#xA0;ft) high. The plant has small, thick, sour-tasting leaves, and in the spring, it bears tiny purple flowers. It grows in saline soil."}
