They simply reaped what they had sown; their fleshly bodies suffered the effects of their wrong ways.

History, both past and present, bears testimony to the truthfulness of this.The nation of Israel fell into gross apostasy, and Ezekiel&#x2019;s prophecy shows the people speaking of themselves as &#x201C;rotting away&#x201D; because of their revolts and sins. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 33:10, 11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> compare 24:23</a>.) As foretold, the nation experienced &#x201C;the sword and the famine and the pestilence,&#x201D; this reaching a climax at the time of the Babylonian invasion. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 32:24</a>) The frequent association of pestilence with sword and famine (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 21:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 27:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/12/2\" data-bid=\"13-3\" class=\"b\"> Eze 7:15</a>) is in harmony with known facts. Pestilence usually accompanies or follows in the wake of war and its associated food shortages. When an enemy force invades a land, agricultural activities are curtailed, crops are often confiscated or burned. Cities under siege are cut off from outside resources, and famine develops among the populace forced to live amid overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Under such circumstances, resistance to disease drops and the way is open for the deadly assault of pestilence.<strong>At &#x201C;the Conclusion of the System of Things.&#x201D; </strong>Jesus, when foretelling Jerusalem&#x2019;s destruction and &#x201C;the conclusion of the system of things,&#x201D; showed that pestilence would be a notable feature of the time period preceding the &#x201C;great tribulation.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/13/2\" data-bid=\"14-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 21:10,&#xA0;11</a>) Written after Jerusalem&#x2019;s destruction (which was accompanied by grave famine and disease), <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 6:1-8</a> pointed to a future time of sword, famine, and &#x201C;deadly plague.&#x201D; These would follow the appearance of the crowned rider on a white horse who goes forth to conquer, a figure precisely paralleling the one of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003450/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, which clearly applies to the reigning Christ Jesus.<span id=\"page618\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"618\" data-before-text=\"618\"></span><strong>Jehovah&#x2019;s Protection. </strong>King Solomon prayed that, when menaced by pestilence, Jehovah&#x2019;s people might pray to Him for relief, spreading out their palms toward the temple, and receive favorable hearing.
