Herodotus (I, 179) speaks of a little river named Is, which flows into the Euphrates, and states that the city of Is on this river is about eight days&#x2019; journey from Babylon. Is has been identified with the modern Hit, and some suggest this as the probable location of Ahava.Concerning the town of Hit, <em>The New Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica </em>(1987, Vol.&#xA0;5, p.&#xA0;949) says: &#x201C;On the Euphrates River, Hit is a small walled town built on two mounds on the site of an ancient city; bitumen wells in the vicinity have been utilized for at least 3,000 years and were used in the building of Babylon.&#x201D; This source of bitumen may correspond to the Biblical account of the construction of the Tower of Babel, in which bitumen served for mortar.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000143/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:3</a>."}
