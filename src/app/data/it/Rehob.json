(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 28,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;30</a>) While some scholars consider both references to denote the same city, other related texts appear to indicate separate sites. Thus, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Judges 1:31, 32</a> says that &#x201C;Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Rehob,&#x201D; so that the Asherites were obliged to dwell among the Canaanites of the land, whereas <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 21:27,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 31</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 6:71,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 75</a> state that Rehob was given to the sons of Gershom (Gershon) as a Levite city. Those favoring but one site consider these texts to mean that the task of evicting the Canaanites from Rehob was hindered originally but was accomplished at a later time, thus allowing for its occupation by the Levites. Those favoring two sites suggest one town as remaining in Canaanite hands, the other as among those initially captured by Asher and given to the Levites. For the two sites, some suggest an identification with Khirbet el-&#x2BD;Amri, about 4&#xA0;km (2.5&#xA0;mi) NE of Achzib, for the Rehob of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003679/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 19:28</a>; and for that of the other texts, they suggest Tell el-Bir el-Gharbi (Tel Bira), about 10&#xA0;km (6&#xA0;mi) ESE of Acco. This latter site is the one preferred by those who consider the name to refer to but one town."}
