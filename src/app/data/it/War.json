A number of Hebrew words involve waging war; one of these, from the verb root <em>qa&#xB7;rav&#x2B9;, </em>means basically &#x201C;come near,&#x201D; that is, to fight. The Greek noun <em>po&#x2B9;le&#xB7;mos </em>means &#x201C;war&#x201D;; and the verb <em>stra&#xB7;teu&#x2B9;o </em>is from a root that refers to an encamped army.The Bible says that Nimrod &#x201C;went forth into Assyria,&#x201D; which was evidently an act of aggression, into the territory of Asshur the son of Shem. There Nimrod built cities.

After they rebelled, Chedorlaomer and his allies warred against them, vanquishing the forces of Sodom and Gomorrah, taking their possessions, and capturing Abraham&#x2019;s nephew Lot and his household. At that Abraham mustered 318 trained servants and, together with his three confederates, pursued Chedorlaomer and recovered the captives and the plunder. However, Abraham did not take any of the booty for himself. This is the first record of a war waged by a servant of God. Abraham&#x2019;s warring to recover his fellow servant of Jehovah had Jehovah&#x2019;s approval, for, on Abraham&#x2019;s return, he was blessed by Melchizedek, priest of the Most High God.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:1-24</a>.<strong>God-Ordained Warfare. </strong>Jehovah is &#x201C;a manly person of war,&#x201D; &#x201C;the God of armies,&#x201D; and &#x201C;mighty in battle.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 15:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 5:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Ps 24:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004573/2/4\" data-bid=\"3-5\" class=\"b\"> Isa 42:13</a>) Not only has he the right as Creator and Supreme Sovereign of the universe but he is also obligated by justice to execute or authorize execution of the lawless, to war against all obstinate ones who refuse to obey his righteous laws.

According to Josephus, they served up to the age of 50 years. (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>III, 288 [xii,&#xA0;4]) The fearful and fainthearted were rejected because Israel&#x2019;s wars were wars of Jehovah, and those displaying weakness of faith in fearfulness would tend to weaken the army&#x2019;s morale. Exemptions were given to men who had just completed a new house, as well as to those who had planted a vineyard and had not used its fruitage. These exemptions were based on the right of a man to enjoy the fruitage of his work. The newly married man was exempt for one year. During this time the man might be able to have and to see an heir.

If the city surrendered, the inhabitants were spared and put to forced labor. This opportunity to surrender, together with the assurance that their lives would be spared and their women would not be raped or molested, was an inducement to such cities to capitulate to Israel&#x2019;s army, thus avoiding much bloodshed. If the city did not surrender, all males were killed. Killing the men removed danger of later revolt by the city. &#x201C;The women and the little children&#x201D; were spared.
