(See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000017/0\">NEBO</a> No.&#xA0;4.) The name Azariah means &#x201C;Jehovah Has Helped,&#x201D; and it appears that these Hebrews, among themselves, continued to use their original names.

Following their release by the shaken king, and after members of the royal court saw that the three men had escaped unharmed, they were restored to royal favor.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000017/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Da 3:15-30</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000017/1\">MESHACH</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000017/2\">SHADRACH</a>."}
