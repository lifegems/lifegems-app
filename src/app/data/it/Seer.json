The Hebrew word <em>ro&#xB7;&#x2BC;eh&#x2B9;, </em>translated &#x201C;seer,&#x201D; is drawn from a root word meaning &#x201C;see,&#x201D; literally or figuratively. The seer was a man consulted by others for wise counsel on problems encountered.

The distinction between the terms may be that &#x201C;seer&#x201D; may relate to discernment, &#x201C;visionary&#x201D; to the manner in which the divine will was made known, and &#x201C;prophet&#x201D; more to the speaking forth or the proclamation of the divine will.
