Delilah is introduced into the Bible account toward the final part of Samson&#x2019;s 20-year judgeship as the object of his love.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001149/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 16:31</a>.The axis lords of the Philistines, anxious to destroy Samson, each offered Delilah 1,100 pieces of silver (if shekels, $2,422) to find out for them wherein Samson&#x2019;s great power lay. She cooperated by questioning Samson as to what would render him powerless. Each time Samson answered, she notified the Philistines and hid in her house Philistine warriors who were ready to take advantage of Samson in the event he lost his strength. After three misleading answers by Samson, Delilah continued to pester him and &#x201C;pressured him with her words all the time and kept urging him, [so that] his soul got to be impatient to the point of dying.&#x201D; Then he told her of his Naziriteship and that no razor had ever touched his head. Certain of having the truth this time, she sent for the Philistine axis lords, and they came to bring her the money. While Samson slept upon her knees, an attendant cut off the seven braids of his hair. Upon awakening, Samson found that this time his divinely provided power was not there. The hiding Philistines grabbed hold of him, blinded him, and took him prisoner. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001149/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 16:4-21</a>) Delilah is mentioned no more in the Bible account.The Bible does not say that sexual relationship took place between Delilah and Samson or that she was a prostitute. The prostitute mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001149/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Judges 16:1, 2</a> is not the same as Delilah. This prostitute lived at Gaza, whereas Delilah lived in the torrent valley of Sorek. Also, the following evidence indicates Delilah possibly was an Israelitess, not a Philistine: When the axis lords presented <span id=\"page609\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"609\" data-before-text=\"609\"></span>their proposal it was based on an extravagant sum of money and not on patriotic sentiment.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001149/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 16:5</a>."}
