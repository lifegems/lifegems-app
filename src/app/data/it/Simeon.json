Arbitrarily, without their father&#x2019;s knowledge or consent, they set about avenging the honor of their younger sister Dinah by slaughtering the Shechemites, bringing ostracism upon Jacob&#x2019;s whole family.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 34:1-31</a>.Simeon was later involved in wrongdoing when he and his brothers planned to kill Joseph.

Years later, when Joseph as food administrator of Egypt was testing out his brothers, Simeon was selected by Joseph to be bound and imprisoned until the other brothers brought Benjamin down to Egypt.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 42:14-24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 34-36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> 43:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>.Shortly before Jacob&#x2019;s death, when blessing his sons, Jacob recalled with disapproval the violence of Simeon and Levi in connection with the Shechemites many years earlier, saying: &#x201C;Instruments of violence are their slaughter weapons. Into their intimate group do not come, O&#xA0;my soul. With their congregation do not become united, O&#xA0;my disposition, because in their anger they killed men, and in their arbitrariness they hamstrung bulls. Cursed be their anger, because it is cruel, and their fury, because it acts harshly.

Simeon had six sons, one from a Canaanite woman. As prophesied, Simeon&#x2019;s tribal allotment was not united with Levi&#x2019;s, but these two were &#x2018;scattered&#x2019;; even internally, Simeon&#x2019;s portion was divided up as enclave cities in Judah&#x2019;s territory.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 46:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Ex 6:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 4:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/5/3\" data-bid=\"6-4\" class=\"b\"> Jos 19:1</a>.<strong>2. </strong>The tribe of Israel stemming from the families of Simeon&#x2019;s six sons: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul.

On the march, this same tribal arrangement was maintained, with Shelumiel serving as Simeon&#x2019;s chieftain, both of the camp and of the army.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 1:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 2:10-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:18-20</a>.<span id=\"page961\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"961\" data-before-text=\"961\"></span><strong>Reduction in Tribal Population. </strong>At the time of the first census, taken a year after the Exodus from Egypt, the tribe of Simeon numbered 59,300 able-bodied men 20 years old and upward who were fit for military service.

This amounted to a decrease of more than 62&#xA0;percent, far greater than that experienced by any other tribe.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 26:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 12-14</a>.Moses did not mention Simeon by name in his farewell blessing of Israel. This is not to say the tribe was not blessed, for it was included at the end in the general blessing.

In this way Jacob&#x2019;s deathbed prophecy uttered more than 200 years earlier was fulfilled.

This latter reference to Josiah&#x2019;s reforms shows that, though geographically in Judah&#x2019;s territory, Simeon had politically and religiously cast in its lot with the northern kingdom. It appears that in the days of Hezekiah 500 Simeonites struck down a remnant of the Amalekites and took up dwelling in their place.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004124/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 4:41-43</a>.In the prophetic books of Ezekiel and Revelation, Simeon&#x2019;s name occurs along with others of the tribes of Israel. The strip of territory assigned to Simeon in Ezekiel&#x2019;s envisioned layout of the Promised Land lay between those of Benjamin and Issachar, S of &#x201C;the holy contribution.&#x201D; But the gate assigned to Simeon on the S of the holy city was with those named after Issachar and Zebulun.
