It is nailed to the doorpost by Orthodox Jews and contains a parchment bearing the words of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 6:4-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:13-21</a>.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/0\">MEZUZAH</a>.The <em>door </em>was generally made of wood, and many of them turned on pivots fitted into sockets in the lintel and the threshold. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 26:14</a>) Door pivots were often wooden, but the Egyptians sometimes fastened to a door&#x2019;s lower and upper ends metal hinges having projections that fitted into sockets, these doors thus pivoting in that way. Sockets for the doors of the temple built by Solomon were of gold.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 7:48,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;50</a>.Doors of average homes were small and not ornate. But the entrance of Solomon&#x2019;s temple had two, two-leaved juniper-wood doors, and there were two doors made of oil-tree wood leading to the Most Holy, all these doors having carved representations of cherubs, palm trees, and blossoms, overlaid with gold. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 6:31-35</a>) Large doors having folding sections or leaves were also used elsewhere. For instance, Jehovah saw to it that Babylon&#x2019;s copper &#x201C;two-leaved doors&#x201D; were opened to King Cyrus.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 45:1,&#xA0;2</a>.For the <em>threshold </em>generally wood or stone was used.
