He thus did not restrict the appearance, existence, and activity of such antichrist to some future time only but showed that the antichrist was then present and would continue on.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 4:3</a>.<strong>Identification. </strong>Although there has been much effort in the past to identify &#x201C;the antichrist&#x201D; with an individual, such as Pompey, Nero, or Muhammad (this latter person being suggested by Pope Innocent&#xA0;III in 1213&#xA0;C.E.), or with a specific organization, as in the Protestant view of &#x201C;the antichrist&#x201D; as applying to the papacy, John&#x2019;s inspired statements show the term to be broad in its application, embracing all those who deny that &#x201C;Jesus is the Christ,&#x201D; and who deny that Jesus is the Son of God who came &#x201C;in the flesh.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 2:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 4:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Jo 7</a>, <em>NE, NIV;</em> compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 8:42,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 48, 49;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:22</a>.<span id=\"page116\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"116\" data-before-text=\"116\"></span>Denial of Jesus as the Christ and as the Son of God of necessity embraces the denial of any or all of the Scriptural teachings concerning him: his origin, his place in God&#x2019;s arrangement, his fulfillment of the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures as the promised Messiah, his ministry and teachings and prophecies, as well as any opposition to or efforts to replace him in his position as God&#x2019;s appointed High Priest and King. This is evident from other texts, which, while not using the term &#x201C;antichrist,&#x201D; express essentially the same idea. Thus, Jesus stated: &#x201C;He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 11:23</a>) <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Second John 7</a> shows that such ones might act as deceivers, and hence the &#x201C;antichrist&#x201D; would include those who are &#x201C;false Christs&#x201D; and &#x201C;false prophets,&#x201D; as well as those who perform powerful works in Jesus&#x2019; name and yet are classed by him as &#x201C;workers of lawlessness.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 7:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> 22,&#xA0;23</a>.In view of Jesus&#x2019; rule that what is done to his true followers is done to him (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 25:40,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 45;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> Ac 9:5</a>), the term must include those who persecute such ones, which means it would include the symbolic &#x201C;Babylon the Great.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;&#x2060;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 21:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000290/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 17:5, 6</a>.John specifically mentions apostates as among those of the antichrist by referring to those who &#x201C;went out from us,&#x201D; abandoning the Christian congregation.
