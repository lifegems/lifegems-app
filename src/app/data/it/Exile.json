These occasions are: (1)&#xA0;Israel&#x2019;s exile by the hand of the Assyrians (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001457/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 15:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001457/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:9-12</a>); (2)&#xA0;Judah&#x2019;s exile in Babylon (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001457/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 25:8-11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001457/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;21</a>); (3)&#xA0;the Jewish exile at the hands of the Romans (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001457/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 21:20-24</a>).<strong>Israel. </strong>Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III took inhabitants of Naphtali into exile in Assyria before Israelite King Pekah&#x2019;s rule ended in about 759&#xA0;B.C.E. Reubenites, Gadites, and those from the eastern half tribe of Manasseh were also carried off by the king of Assyria, apparently at the same time.

In the time of Ahasuerus (Xerxes&#xA0;I, king of Persia, who ruled from India to Ethiopia, over 127 jurisdictional districts), Haman, in making an indictment of them, said: &#x201C;There is one certain people scattered and separated among the peoples in all the jurisdictional districts of your realm.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001457/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Es 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001457/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:8</a>.<strong>In the First Century C.E. </strong>In the first century C.E. there were settlements of Jews in Thessalonica, Athens, Corinth, Ephesus, Rome, and Babylon, as well as in other cities.

(<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>XV, 14 [ii,&#xA0;2]) In 49 or early 50&#xA0;C.E. the Roman emperor Claudius banished all the Jews from Rome. This also affected Jews who had become Christians, among them Aquila and Priscilla (Prisca), whom Paul met in Corinth about 50&#xA0;C.E., shortly after the edict by Claudius.
