The fact that Adam and Eve rebelled also raised another issue: Would all other intelligent creatures prove unfaithful and disloyal to God when obedience appeared to bring no material benefits? Satan&#x2019;s claim respecting faithful Job implied that they would do so. Satan said: &#x201C;Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004603/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 2:4,&#xA0;5</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004603/0\">SOVEREIGNTY</a>.Time was required to settle the issues that had been raised. Hence, Jehovah God, by permitting wicked persons to continue living, made it possible for others to share in proving Satan&#x2019;s claim false by serving God faithfully under unfavorable and trialsome circumstances. God&#x2019;s permission of wickedness has also provided an opportunity for individuals to abandon a wrong course and to subject themselves willingly to God&#x2019;s righteous laws.

Though they oppose God, he can restrain them to the extent necessary for the preserving of his servants in their integrity, and can cause the actions even of such persons to bring his righteousness to the fore.

God did not make this Egyptian ruler wicked, but he did allow him to continue living and also brought about circumstances that caused Pharaoh to manifest himself as being wicked and deserving of death.
