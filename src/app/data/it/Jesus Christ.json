He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, &#x201C;I live because of the Father.&#x201D; According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus&#x2019; ransom sacrifice.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 6:56,&#xA0;57</a>.If the estimates of modern-day scientists as to the age of the physical universe are anywhere near correct, Jesus&#x2019; existence as a spirit creature began thousands of millions of years prior to the creation of the first human. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 5:2</a>.) This firstborn spirit Son was used by his Father in the creation of all other things.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 8:1</a>) Many professed Christian writers of the early centuries of the Common Era understood this section to refer symbolically to God&#x2019;s Son in his prehuman state. In view of the texts already considered, there can be no denying that that Son was &#x201C;produced&#x201D; by Jehovah &#x201C;as the beginning of his way, the earliest of his achievements of long ago,&#x201D; nor that the Son was &#x201C;beside [Jehovah] as a master worker&#x201D; during earth&#x2019;s creation, <span id=\"page53\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"53\" data-before-text=\"53\"></span>as described in these verses of Proverbs. It is true that in Hebrew, which assigns gender to its nouns (as do many other languages), the word for &#x201C;wisdom&#x201D; is always in the feminine gender. This would continue to be the case even though wisdom is personified and so would not rule out wisdom&#x2019;s being used figuratively to represent God&#x2019;s firstborn Son. The Greek word for &#x201C;love&#x201D; in the expression &#x201C;God is love&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 4:8</a>) is also in the feminine gender but that does not make God feminine. Solomon, the principal writer of Proverbs (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 1:1</a>), applied the title <em>qo&#xB7;he&#x2B9;leth </em>(congregator) to himself (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 1:1</a>) and this word is also in the feminine gender.Wisdom is manifest only by being expressed in some way. God&#x2019;s own wisdom was expressed in creation (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 3:19,&#xA0;20</a>) but <em>through </em>his Son. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 8:6</a>.) So, too, God&#x2019;s wise purpose involving mankind is made manifest through, and summed up in, his Son, Jesus Christ. Thus, the apostle could say that Christ represents &#x201C;the power of God and the wisdom of God&#x201D; and that Christ Jesus &#x201C;has become to us wisdom from God, also righteousness and sanctification and release by ransom.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 1:24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> 30</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 2:7,&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 8:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/24/2\" data-bid=\"25-3\" class=\"b\"> 10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/24/3\" data-bid=\"25-4\" class=\"b\"> 18-21</a>.<strong><em>How he is the &#x201C;only-begotten Son.&#x201D; </em></strong>Jesus&#x2019; being called the &#x201C;only-begotten Son&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/25/2\" data-bid=\"26-3\" class=\"b\"> 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/25/3\" data-bid=\"26-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Jo 4:9</a>) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God&#x2019;s sons, for they are called sons as well.

So &#x201C;the Word&#x201D; was Jehovah&#x2019;s &#x201C;only-begotten Son&#x201D; in a particular sense, even as Isaac was Abraham&#x2019;s &#x201C;only-begotten son&#x201D; in a particular sense (his father already having another son but not by his wife Sarah).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 11:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> Ge 16:15</a>.<strong><em>Why called &#x201C;the Word.&#x201D; </em></strong>The name (or, perhaps, title) &#x201C;the Word&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:1</a>) apparently identifies the function that God&#x2019;s firstborn Son performed after other intelligent creatures were formed. A similar expression is found at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Exodus 4:16</a>, where Jehovah says to Moses concerning his brother Aaron: &#x201C;And he must speak for you to the people; and it must occur that he will serve as a mouth to you, and you will serve as God to him.&#x201D; As spokesman for God&#x2019;s chief representative on earth, Aaron served as &#x201C;a mouth&#x201D; for Moses. Likewise with the Word, or Logos, who became Jesus Christ. Jehovah evidently used his Son to convey information and instructions to others of his family of spirit sons, even as he used that Son to deliver his message to humans on earth. Showing that he was God&#x2019;s Word, or Spokesman, Jesus said to his Jewish listeners: &#x201C;What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me. If anyone desires to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching whether it is from God or I speak of my own originality.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 7:16, 17</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 12:50;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/31/1\" data-bid=\"32-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:37</a>.Doubtless on many occasions during his prehuman existence as the Word, Jesus acted as Jehovah&#x2019;s Spokesman to persons on earth. While certain texts refer to Jehovah as though directly speaking to humans, other texts make clear that he did so through an angelic representative. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 3:2-4</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 7:30,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\"> 35</a>; also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 16:7-11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/34/1\" data-bid=\"35-2\" class=\"b\"> 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/34/2\" data-bid=\"35-3\" class=\"b\"> 22:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/34/3\" data-bid=\"35-4\" class=\"b\"> 11, 12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/34/4\" data-bid=\"35-5\" class=\"b\"> 15-18</a>.) Reasonably, in the majority of such cases God spoke through the Word. He likely did so in Eden, for on two of the three occasions where mention is made of God&#x2019;s speaking there, the record specifically shows someone was with Him, undoubtedly his Son.

It is clearly proper to capitalize &#x201C;God&#x201D; in translating the phrase &#x201C;the god,&#x201D; since this must identify the Almighty God with whom the Word was. But the capitalizing of the word &#x201C;god&#x201D; in the second case does not have the same justification.<span id=\"page54\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"54\" data-before-text=\"54\"></span>The <em>New World Translation </em>renders this text: &#x201C;In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.&#x201D; True, there is no indefinite article (corresponding to &#x201C;a&#x201D; or &#x201C;an&#x201D;) in the original Greek text. But this does not mean one should not be used in translation, for Koine, or common Greek, <em>had no indefinite article. </em>Hence, throughout the Christian Greek Scriptures, translators are obliged to use the indefinite article or not according to their understanding of the meaning of the text. All English translations of those Scriptures do contain the indefinite article hundreds of times; yet most do not use it at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:1</a>. Nevertheless, its use in the rendering of this text has sound basis.First, it should be noted that the text itself shows that the Word was <em>&#x201C;with </em>God,&#x201D; hence could not <em>be </em>God, that is, be the Almighty God.

Additionally, the word for &#x201C;god&#x201D; (Gr., <em>the&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>) in its second occurrence in the verse is significantly without the definite article &#x201C;the&#x201D; (Gr., <em>ho</em>). Regarding this fact, Ernst Haenchen, in a commentary on the Gospel of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">John (chapters&#xA0;1-6</a>), stated: &#x201C;[<em>the&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>] and [<em>ho the&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>] (&#x2018;god, divine&#x2019; and &#x2018;the God&#x2019;) were not the same thing in this period. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. In fact, for the .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Evangelist, only the Father was &#x2018;God&#x2019; ([<em>ho the&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>]; cf. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">17:3</a>); &#x2018;the Son&#x2019; was subordinate to him (cf. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">14:28</a>). But that is only hinted at in this passage because here the emphasis is on the proximity of the one to the other . .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. It was quite possible in Jewish and Christian monotheism to speak of divine beings that existed alongside and under God but were not identical with him. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Phil 2:6-10</a> proves that. In that passage Paul depicts just such a divine being, who later became man in Jesus Christ .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Thus, in both Philippians and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:1</a> it is not a matter of a dialectical relationship between two-in-one, but of a personal union of two entities.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>John</em> <em>1, </em>translated by R.&#xA0;W.&#xA0;Funk, 1984, pp.&#xA0;109, 110.After giving as a translation of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:1c</a> &#x201C;and divine (of the category divinity) was the Word,&#x201D; Haenchen goes on to state: &#x201C;In this instance, the verb &#x2018;was&#x2019; ([<em>en</em>]) simply expresses predication. And the predicate noun must accordingly be more carefully observed: [<em>the&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>] is not the same thing as [<em>ho the&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>] (&#x2018;divine&#x2019; is not the same thing as &#x2018;God&#x2019;).&#x201D; (pp.&#xA0;110, 111) Elaborating on this point, Philip B.&#xA0;Harner brought out that the grammatical construction in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:1</a> involves an anarthrous predicate, that is, a predicate noun without the definite article &#x201C;the,&#x201D; preceding the verb, which construction is primarily qualitative in meaning and indicates that &#x201C;the <em>logos </em>has the nature of <em>theos.&#x201D; </em>He further stated: &#x201C;In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:1</a> I think that the qualitative force of the predicate is so prominent that the noun [<em>the&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>] cannot be regarded as definite.&#x201D; (<em>Journal of Biblical Literature, </em>1973, pp.&#xA0;85,&#xA0;87) Other translators, also recognizing that the Greek term has qualitative force and describes the nature of the Word, therefore render the phrase: &#x201C;the Word was divine.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>AT; Sd; </em>compare <em>Mo; </em>see <em>NW </em>appendix, p.&#xA0;1579.The Hebrew Scriptures are consistently clear in showing that there is but one Almighty God, the Creator of all things and the Most High, whose name is Jehovah.

The oneness to which Jesus referred must be understood in harmony with the context of his statement. He was speaking of his works and his care of the &#x201C;sheep&#x201D; who would follow him. His works, as well as his words, demonstrated that there was unity, not disunity and disharmony, between him and his Father, a point his reply went on to emphasize.

As regards his &#x201C;sheep,&#x201D; he and his Father were likewise at unity in their protecting such sheeplike ones and leading them to everlasting life.

Jesus&#x2019; prayer on behalf of the unity of all his disciples, including future ones, shows that the oneness, or union, between Jesus and his Father was not as to identity of person but as to purpose and action. In this way Jesus&#x2019; disciples could &#x201C;all be one,&#x201D; just as he and his Father are one.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/73/0\" data-bid=\"74-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 17:20-23</a>.In harmony with this, Jesus, responding to a question by Thomas, said: &#x201C;If you men had known me, you would have known my Father also; from this moment on you know him and have seen him,&#x201D; and, in answer to a question from Philip, Jesus added: &#x201C;He that has seen me has seen the Father also.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/74/0\" data-bid=\"75-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:5-9</a>) Again, Jesus&#x2019; following explanation shows that this was so because he faithfully represented his Father, spoke the Father&#x2019;s words, and did the Father&#x2019;s works. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/75/0\" data-bid=\"76-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:10, 11</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/76/0\" data-bid=\"77-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 12:28,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/76/1\" data-bid=\"77-2\" class=\"b\"> 44-49</a>.)

Jacob, for instance, said to Esau: &#x201C;I have seen your face as though seeing God&#x2019;s face in that you received me with pleasure.&#x201D; He said this because Esau&#x2019;s reaction had been in harmony with Jacob&#x2019;s prayer to God.

However, others claim the original Greek requires that the words be viewed as being directed to Jesus. Even if this is so, the expression &#x201C;My Lord and my God&#x201D; would still have to harmonize with the rest of the inspired Scriptures. Since the record shows that Jesus had previously sent his disciples the message, &#x201C;I am ascending to my Father and your Father and <em>to my God </em>and your God,&#x201D; there is no reason for believing that Thomas thought Jesus was the Almighty God.

This, however, was not the case with the coming of God&#x2019;s Son to earth to become the man Jesus. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/92/0\" data-bid=\"93-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:14</a> says that &#x201C;the Word became flesh and resided among us.&#x201D; For that reason he could call himself &#x201C;the Son of man.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/93/0\" data-bid=\"94-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:51;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/93/1\" data-bid=\"94-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:14,&#xA0;15</a>) Some draw attention to the expression &#x201C;resided [literally, &#x201C;tented&#x201D;] among us&#x201D; and claim this shows Jesus was, not a true human, but an incarnation.

It is likely, therefore, that the child born resembled its Jewish mother in certain physical characteristics.Mary was a descendant of the sinner Adam, hence herself imperfect and sinful. The question therefore is raised as to how Jesus, Mary&#x2019;s &#x201C;firstborn&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/99/0\" data-bid=\"100-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:7</a>), could be perfect and free from sin in his physical organism. While modern geneticists have learned much about laws of heredity and about dominant and recessive characteristics, they have had no experience in learning the results of uniting perfection with imperfection, as was the case with Jesus&#x2019; conception. From the results revealed in the Bible, it would appear that the perfect male life-force (causing the conception) canceled out any imperfection existent in Mary&#x2019;s ovum, thereby producing a genetic pattern (and embryonic development) that was perfect from its start. Whatever the case, the operation of God&#x2019;s holy spirit at the time guaranteed the success of God&#x2019;s purpose. As the angel Gabriel explained to Mary, &#x201C;power of the Most High&#x201D; overshadowed her so that what was born was holy, God&#x2019;s Son. God&#x2019;s holy spirit formed, as it were, a protective wall so that no imperfection or hurtful force could damage, or blemish, the developing embryo, from conception on.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/100/0\" data-bid=\"101-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 1:35</a>.Since it was God&#x2019;s holy spirit that made the birth possible, Jesus owed his human life to his heavenly Father, not to any man, such as his adoptive father Joseph.

Different from this, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/133/0\" data-bid=\"134-1\" class=\"b\">John 5:1</a> clearly implies that it was the particular &#x201C;festival of the Jews&#x201D; that caused Jesus to go from Galilee (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/134/0\" data-bid=\"135-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 4:54</a>) to Jerusalem.The only other festival between Chislev and Passover time was that of Purim, held in Adar (February-March), about one month before Passover. But the postexilic Feast of Purim was likewise celebrated throughout the land in homes and synagogues. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/10\">PURIM</a>.) So, the Passover seems to be the most likely &#x201C;festival of the Jews&#x201D; referred to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/135/0\" data-bid=\"136-1\" class=\"b\">John 5:1</a>, Jesus&#x2019; attendance at Jerusalem then being in conformity to God&#x2019;s law to Israel. It is true that John thereafter records only a few events before the next mention of the Passover (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/136/0\" data-bid=\"137-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 6:4</a>), but a consideration of the chart of the Main Events of Jesus&#x2019; Earthly Life will show that John&#x2019;s coverage of Jesus&#x2019; early ministry was very abbreviated, many events already discussed by the other three evangelists being passed over. In fact, the great amount of activity of Jesus as recorded by these other evangelists (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) lends weight to the conclusion that an annual Passover did indeed intervene between those recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/137/0\" data-bid=\"138-1\" class=\"b\">John 2:13</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/138/0\" data-bid=\"139-1\" class=\"b\">6:4</a>.<strong><em>Time of his death. </em></strong>The death of Jesus Christ took place in the spring, on the Passover Day, Nisan (or Abib) 14, according to the Jewish calendar. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/139/0\" data-bid=\"140-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/139/1\" data-bid=\"140-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 13:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/139/2\" data-bid=\"140-3\" class=\"b\"> Ex 12:1-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/139/3\" data-bid=\"140-4\" class=\"b\"> 13:4</a>) That year the Passover occurred on the sixth day of the week (counted by the Jews as from sundown on Thursday to sundown on Friday). This is evident from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/140/0\" data-bid=\"141-1\" class=\"b\">John 19:31</a>, which shows that the following day was &#x201C;a great&#x201D; sabbath. The day after Passover was always a sabbath, no matter on what day of the week it came. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/141/0\" data-bid=\"142-1\" class=\"b\">Le 23:5-7</a>) But when this special Sabbath coincided with the regular Sabbath (the seventh day of the week), it became &#x201C;a great one.&#x201D; So Jesus&#x2019; death took place on Friday, Nisan 14, by about 3:00&#xA0;p.m.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/142/0\" data-bid=\"143-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 23:44-46</a>.<strong><em>Summary of evidence. </em></strong>Summing up, then, since Jesus&#x2019; death took place in the spring month of Nisan, his ministry, which began three and a half years earlier according to <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/143/0\" data-bid=\"144-1\" class=\"b\">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, must have begun in the <em>fall, </em>about the month of Ethanim (September-October). John&#x2019;s ministry (initiated in Tiberius&#x2019; 15th year), then, must have begun in the <em>spring </em>of the year 29&#xA0;C.E. John&#x2019;s birth therefore would be placed in the spring of the year 2&#xA0;B.C.E., Jesus&#x2019; birth would come about six months later in the fall of 2&#xA0;B.C.E., his ministry would start about 30 years later in the fall of 29&#xA0;C.E., and his death would come in the year 33&#xA0;C.E. (on Nisan 14 in the spring, as stated).<strong><em>No basis for winter date of birth. </em></strong>The popular date of December&#xA0;25 as the day of Jesus&#x2019; birth therefore has no basis in Scripture. As many reference works show, it stems from a pagan holiday. Regarding the origin for the celebration of the day December&#xA0;25, the Jesuit scholar Urbanus Holzmeister wrote:&#x201C;Today it is commonly admitted that the occasion for the celebration of the day December&#xA0;25 was the festival that the pagans were celebrating on this day. Petavius [French Jesuit scholar, 1583-1652] already has rightly observed that on December&#xA0;25 was celebrated &#x2018;the birthday of the unconquered sun.&#x2019;&#x201C;Witnesses for this festival are: (a)&#xA0;The <em>Calendar </em>of Furius Dionysius Filocalus, composed in the year 354 [C.E.], in which it is noted: &#x2018;December&#xA0;25, the B(irthday) of the unconquered (Sun).&#x2019; (b)&#xA0;The calendar of astrologer Antiochus (composed about 200 [C.E.]): &#x2018;Month of December .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. 25 .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The birthday of the Sun; daylight increases.&#x2019; (c)&#xA0;Caesar Julian [Julian the Apostate, emperor 361-363&#xA0;C.E.] recommended the games that were celebrated at the end of the year in honor of the sun, which was called &#x2018;the unconquered sun.&#x2019;&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Chronologia vitae Christi </em>(Chronology of the Life of Christ), Pontificium Institutum Biblicum, Rome, 1933, p.&#xA0;46.Perhaps the most obvious evidence of the incorrectness of the December&#xA0;25 date is the Scriptural fact that shepherds were in the fields tending their flocks on the night of Jesus&#x2019; birth. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/144/0\" data-bid=\"145-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/144/1\" data-bid=\"145-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;12</a>) Already by the autumn month of Bul (October-November) the rainy season was starting (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/145/0\" data-bid=\"146-1\" class=\"b\">De 11:14</a>), and flocks were brought into protected shelters at night. The next month, Chislev (the ninth month of the Jewish calendar, November-December), was a month of cold and rain (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/146/0\" data-bid=\"147-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 36:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/146/1\" data-bid=\"147-2\" class=\"b\"> Ezr 10:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/146/2\" data-bid=\"147-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>), and Tebeth (December-January) saw the lowest temperatures of the year, with occasional snows in the highlands area. The presence of shepherds in the fields at night therefore harmonizes with the evidence pointing to the early autumn month of Ethanim as the time of Jesus&#x2019; birth.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/11\">BUL</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/12\">CHISLEV</a>.Also weighing against a December date is that it would be most unlikely for the Roman emperor to choose such a wintry, rainy month as the time for his Jewish subjects (often rebellious) to travel &#x201C;each one to his own city&#x201D; to be registered.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/147/0\" data-bid=\"148-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:1-3</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/148/0\" data-bid=\"149-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:20</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/13\">TEBETH</a>.<strong>Early Life. </strong>The record of Jesus&#x2019; early life is very brief.

Thus Jesus, who on his first day of human life had slept in a stable, evidently spent his childhood in quite humble circumstances. Nazareth was not historically prominent, though near to two principal trade routes. It may have been looked down upon by many Jews.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/153/0\" data-bid=\"154-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:46</a>; see PICTURES, Vol.&#xA0;2, p.&#xA0;539; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/14\">NAZARETH</a>.Of the first years of Jesus&#x2019; life nothing is known except that &#x201C;the young child continued growing and getting strong, being filled with wisdom, and God&#x2019;s favor continued upon him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/154/0\" data-bid=\"155-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:40</a>) In course of time the family grew as four sons and some daughters were born to Joseph and Mary.

This doubtless explains why his parents could begin a return journey from Jerusalem without realizing for a while that Jesus, their oldest child, was missing from the group. This occasion, with Jesus&#x2019; visit (as a 12-year-old) to the temple, where he engaged in a discussion with the Jewish teachers that left them amazed, is the only incident of his early life recounted in some detail. (PICTURE, Vol.&#xA0;2, p.&#xA0;538) Jesus&#x2019; reply to his worried parents when they located him there shows that Jesus knew the miraculous nature of his birth and realized his Messianic future.

The changing of water to wine at Cana, performed during his ministry, was &#x201C;the beginning of his signs.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/159/0\" data-bid=\"160-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 2:1-11</a>) Likewise, while among the family in Nazareth, Jesus evidently did not make a showy display of his wisdom and superiority as a perfect human, as is perhaps indicated by the fact that his half brothers did not exercise faith in him during his ministry as a human, as well as by the disbelief most of the population of Nazareth showed toward him.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/160/0\" data-bid=\"161-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 7:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/160/1\" data-bid=\"161-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 6:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/160/2\" data-bid=\"161-3\" class=\"b\"> 4-6</a>.Yet Jesus was evidently well known by the people of Nazareth (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/161/0\" data-bid=\"162-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 13:54-56;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/161/1\" data-bid=\"162-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 4:22</a>); his splendid qualities and personality must certainly have been noted, at least by those appreciative of righteousness and goodness.

His childhood and the growing-up process, like his birth, were necessary, though incidental, means to an end. As Jesus later stated to Roman Governor Pilate: &#x201C;For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/165/0\" data-bid=\"166-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 18:37</a>.<strong>His Baptism. </strong>The outpouring of holy spirit at the time of Jesus&#x2019; baptism marked the time of his becoming in actual fact the Messiah, or Christ, God&#x2019;s Anointed One (the use of this title by angels when announcing his birth evidently being in a prophetic sense; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/166/0\" data-bid=\"167-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:9-11</a>, note also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/167/0\" data-bid=\"168-1\" class=\"b\">vss 25, 26</a>).

Thereby he would prove to be &#x201C;the Amen&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;, the faithful and true witness.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/250/0\" data-bid=\"251-1\" class=\"b\">Re 3:14</a>) If he failed, he would reproach his Father&#x2019;s name as none other could.In selecting his only-begotten Son, Jehovah, of course, was not &#x2018;laying his hands hastily upon him,&#x2019; with the risk of being &#x2018;a sharer in possible sins,&#x2019; for Jesus was no novice likely to get &#x201C;puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed upon the Devil.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/251/0\" data-bid=\"252-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 5:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/251/1\" data-bid=\"252-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:6</a>.)

He had already had great responsibility as God&#x2019;s Spokesman, the Word. Yet he never misused his position and authority, as did God&#x2019;s earthly spokesman Moses on one occasion. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/256/0\" data-bid=\"257-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 20:9-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/256/1\" data-bid=\"257-2\" class=\"b\"> De 32:48-51;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/256/2\" data-bid=\"257-3\" class=\"b\"> Jude&#xA0;9</a>) Being the One through whom all things were made, the Son was a god, &#x201C;the only-begotten god&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/257/0\" data-bid=\"258-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:18</a>), hence held a position of glory and preeminence in relation to all others of God&#x2019;s spirit sons. Yet he did not become haughty. (Contrast <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/258/0\" data-bid=\"259-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 28:14-17</a>.) So, it could not be said that the Son had not already proved his loyalty, humility, and devotion in many respects.To illustrate, consider the test placed upon God&#x2019;s first human son, Adam. That test did not involve enduring persecution or suffering, but only maintaining obedient respect for God&#x2019;s will in regard to the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/259/0\" data-bid=\"260-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:16, 17</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/23\">TREES</a>.) Satan&#x2019;s rebellion and temptation were not part of the test as originally given by God but came as an added feature, from a source foreign to God. Nor did the test, when given, call for any human temptation, as resulted to Adam from Eve&#x2019;s deflection. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/260/0\" data-bid=\"261-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/260/1\" data-bid=\"261-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;12</a>) This being so, Adam&#x2019;s test could have been effected without any outside temptation or influence toward wrongdoing, the whole matter resting with Adam&#x2019;s heart<wbr>&#x2014;his love for God and his freedom from selfishness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/261/0\" data-bid=\"262-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 4:23</a>) Proving faithful, Adam would have been privileged to take fruit of &#x201C;the tree of life and eat and live to time indefinite&#x201D; as a tested, approved human son of God (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/262/0\" data-bid=\"263-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:22</a>), all of this without having been subjected to vile influence and temptation, persecution, or suffering.It may also be noted that the spirit son who became Satan by defecting from God&#x2019;s service did not do so because anyone had persecuted him or tempted him to do wrong. Certainly not God, for &#x2018;He does not try anyone with evil things.&#x2019; Yet that spirit son failed to maintain loyalty, allowed himself to be &#x201C;drawn out and enticed by his own desire,&#x201D; and sinned, becoming a rebel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/263/0\" data-bid=\"264-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 1:13-15</a>) He failed the test of love.The issue raised by God&#x2019;s Adversary, however, required that the Son, as the promised Messiah and future King of God&#x2019;s Kingdom, now undergo a test of integrity under new circumstances. This test and the sufferings it entailed were also necessary for his being &#x201C;made perfect&#x201D; for his position as God&#x2019;s High Priest over mankind.

The matter was not one-sided, resting solely with the Almighty God, Jehovah. His Son must do his part to make the prophecies come true.
