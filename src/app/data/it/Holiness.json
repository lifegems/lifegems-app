Holiness means &#x201C;religious cleanness or purity; sacredness.&#x201D; Also, the original Hebrew <em>qo&#x2B9;dhesh </em>conveys the thought of separateness, exclusiveness, or sanctification to God, who is holy; a state of being set aside to the service of God. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the words rendered &#x201C;holy&#x201D; (<em>ha&#x2B9;gi&#xB7;os</em>) and &#x201C;holiness&#x201D; (<em>ha&#xB7;gi&#xB7;a&#xB7;smos&#x2B9; </em>[also, &#x201C;sanctification&#x201D;]; <em>ha&#xB7;gi&#xB7;o&#x2B9;tes; ha&#xB7;gi&#xB7;o&#xB7;sy&#x2B9;ne</em>) likewise denote separation to God; they also are used to refer to holiness as a quality of God and to purity or perfection in one&#x2019;s personal conduct.<strong>Jehovah. </strong>The quality of holiness belongs to Jehovah.

The days prior to his becoming unclean did not count toward the fulfillment of his Naziriteship; he had to begin anew the carrying out of his vow.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002055/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 6:1-12</a>.<strong>Places. </strong>A place is made holy by the presence of Jehovah.
