The name Sorek, which means &#x201C;Choice Red Vine,&#x201D; seems to be preserved in Khirbet Suriq, about 25&#xA0;km (16&#xA0;mi) W of Jerusalem, situated on the N side of the wadi and opposite Beth-shemesh. Much of this region, as today, was probably suited for vineyards (a possible reason for its name). The Philistine wagon that returned the ark of the covenant to the Israelites evidently followed the torrent valley of Sorek from Ekron on the road to Beth-shemesh.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004187/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 5:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004187/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 6:10-12</a>."}
