A tower near which Jacob (Israel) pitched his tent sometime after the death of Rachel. Although its exact location is not known, it was apparently located some place between Bethlehem and Hebron. The name Eder indicates it provided shelter for shepherds and served as a watchtower from which they could oversee their flocks.
