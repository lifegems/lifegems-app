(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003877/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 23:7-10</a>.) So sects were to be avoided, being among the works of the flesh. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003877/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 5:19-21</a>) Christians were warned against becoming promoters of sects or being led astray by false teachers.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003877/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Tit 3:10</a>) Those who refused to become involved in creating divisions within the congregation or in supporting a particular faction would distinguish themselves by their faithful course and give evidence of having God&#x2019;s approval. This is apparently what Paul meant when telling the Corinthians: &#x201C;There must also be sects among you, that the persons approved may also become manifest among you.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003877/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 11:19</a>."}
