(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000896/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 15:16</a>) These pods grow on the carob tree (<em>Ceratonia siliqua</em>), an attractive evergreen that grows throughout Palestine as well as in the rest of the Mediterranean area. The tree reaches a height of up to 9&#xA0;m (30&#xA0;ft), with small glistening leaves resembling those of the ash. The fruit or pods have a shiny leathery shell of a purplish-brown color and, in harmony with their name in Greek (<em>ke&#xB7;ra&#x2B9;ti&#xB7;on, </em>&#x201C;small horn&#x201D;), have a <span id=\"page421\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"421\" data-before-text=\"421\"></span>curved horn shape. They measure from 15 to 25&#xA0;cm (6 to 10&#xA0;in.) in length and about 2.5&#xA0;cm (1&#xA0;in.) in width. Inside are several pealike seeds separated from one another by a sweet, sticky, edible pulp. Carob pods are widely used till this day as a food for horses, cattle, and pigs. Grafting of the trees is employed to produce a quality of carob that people also eat."}
