Identified by <span id=\"page282\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"282\" data-before-text=\"282\"></span>Eusebius and Jerome with a place called Loueitha, Luhith has been linked with either Rujm Madinat er Ras, about 20&#xA0;km (12&#xA0;mi) SW of Karak, or nearby Khirbet Fas. Another view is that Luhith was not a city but merely the name of the ascent or slope to be used by the fleeing and weeping Moabite refugees.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002789/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 34:4</a>."}
