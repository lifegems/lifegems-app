They delighted to be called &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D; as an honorary title.

Jesus is addressed by Mary Magdalene as <em>&#x201C;Rabboni&#x201D; </em>(My Teacher), also by a blind man whom he healed. The personal pronoun &#x201C;my&#x201D; is a suffix here, but because of usage it seems to have lost its significance, as in <em>Monsieur, </em>originally meaning &#x201C;my lord.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003613/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 20:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003613/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 10:51</a>) John the Baptizer is once addressed as Rabbi.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003613/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:26</a>."}
