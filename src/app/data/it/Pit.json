The pits of bitumen into which the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fell were evidently natural sunken places in the area (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:10</a>); whereas the pit into which Joseph&#x2019;s brothers threw him was evidently a man-made waterpit. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 37:20-29</a>) The two principal Hebrew words for pit are <em>bohr </em>(also meaning &#x201C;waterpit&#x201D; or &#x201C;cistern&#x201D;) and <em>sha&#x2B9;chath.</em>The Hebrew word <em>she&#x2BC;ohl&#x2B9; </em>is translated &#x201C;pit&#x201D; three times in the <em>King James Version. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 16:30,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Job 17:16</a>) However, Sheol actually refers to the common grave of mankind rather than to an individual grave. In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Job 17:13-16</a> we find Sheol and the pit (Heb., <em>sha&#x2B9;chath</em>) used in parallel by Job as places of darkness and dust. Similarly, David&#x2019;s prayer to God at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 30:3</a> says: &#x201C;O&#xA0;Jehovah, you have brought up my soul from Sheol itself; you have kept me alive, that I should not go down into the pit.&#x201D; In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 88:3-5</a> reference is made to Sheol, the pit, and the burial place in that order.<wbr>&#x2014;See also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 33:18-30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 30:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/3\" data-bid=\"7-4\" class=\"b\"> 49:7-10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/4\" data-bid=\"7-5\" class=\"b\"> 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/5\" data-bid=\"7-6\" class=\"b\"> 88:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/6\" data-bid=\"7-7\" class=\"b\"> 143:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/7\" data-bid=\"7-8\" class=\"b\"> Pr 1:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/8\" data-bid=\"7-9\" class=\"b\"> Isa 14:9-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/9\" data-bid=\"7-10\" class=\"b\"> 38:17, 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/6/10\" data-bid=\"7-11\" class=\"b\"> 51:14</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/0\">GRAVE</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/1\">SHEOL</a>.Jonah also used the word for &#x201C;pit&#x201D; in a figurative sense when he compared the inside of the fish to &#x201C;the belly of Sheol&#x201D; as well as to &#x201C;the pit.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Jon 2:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003502/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;6</a>) Such association of the pit with death and the grave was quite natural in view of the ancient custom of using or excavating a pit as a grave site.Pits were evidently used as a means of trapping or ensnaring an enemy or for catching animals, and so are used in a figurative sense to stand for dangerous situations or intrigues besetting God&#x2019;s servants.
