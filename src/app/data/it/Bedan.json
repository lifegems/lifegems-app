(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000600/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 12:11</a>) However, nowhere else in the Bible nor in secular history is mention made of such a Bedan. Regarding this text, C.&#xA0;F.&#xA0;Keil and F.&#xA0;Delitzsch remark: &#x201C;It is extremely improbable that Samuel should have mentioned a judge here, who had been passed over in the book of Judges on account of his comparative insignificance.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Commentary on the Old Testament, </em>1973, Vol.&#xA0;II, 1&#xA0;Samuel, p.&#xA0;118.Bedan is by some understood to refer to Barak. The context of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000600/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 12:11</a> denotes a major deliverer and recalls the oppression by Sisera and the deliverance that followed, a deliverance in which Jehovah used Barak. Barak is named along with Gideon and Jephthah in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000600/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 11:32</a>.
