It may be for a good or for a deceptive purpose. The Hebrew word for &#x201C;adornment&#x201D; is <em>hadha&#xB7;rah&#x2B9;, </em>evidently from the root <em>ha&#xB7;dhar&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;honor.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 16:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> La 5:12</a>) At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Peter 3:3</a> &#x201C;adornment&#x201D; translates the Greek word <em>ko&#x2B9;smos, </em>elsewhere rendered &#x201C;world.&#x201D; The related verb <em>ko&#xB7;sme&#x2B9;o </em>is translated &#x201C;adorn.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Tit 2:10</a>.The Scriptures do not condemn physical adornment if it is properly done, and they highly recommend spiritual adornment. Jehovah himself is described as clothed in light and surrounded by beauty.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 2:13</a>) Through his prophets Jehovah foretold a restoration of Israel when she would come out of Babylonian exile and again adorn herself to express her joy and exultation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 52:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 31:4</a>.The temple in Jerusalem and Solomon&#x2019;s governmental buildings were beautifully adorned, to the delight of the queen of Sheba.

But Jesus showed that these material adornments would be of no avail when God&#x2019;s judgment came upon Jerusalem for her unfaithfulness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 21:5,&#xA0;6</a>.The Proverbs show that if a great number of people choose to live under and delight in the rule of a king, this is one measure of his success.

The apostle Paul said that Christian women should &#x201C;adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with <span id=\"page52\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"52\" data-before-text=\"52\"></span>styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive garb.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 2:9</a>) During the days of the apostles it was a custom among women in that world of Greek culture to go in for elaborate coiffures and other adornment. How appropriate, therefore, is Peter&#x2019;s counsel to women in the Christian congregation not to put emphasis on &#x2018;the external braiding of the hair and the putting on of gold ornaments or the wearing of outer garments&#x2019; but to let their adornment be, as with the faithful women of old, &#x201C;the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible apparel of the quiet and mild spirit&#x201D;!<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:3-5</a>.The apostle Paul points out that the Christian can, by fine works of incorruptibleness in his teaching, seriousness, wholesome speech, and right conduct in all his ways of life, adorn the teachings of God, making them attractive to others. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Tit 2:10</a>) In this spiritual way, the Christian congregation, the bride of Christ, eventually appears in her full beauty to her husband Jesus Christ. She is similarly described at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 21:2</a> as &#x201C;prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&#x201D; Her spiritual beauty is a direct contrast to the adornment of Babylon the Great, spoken of as adorned with material things, the wage of her prostitution.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Re 18:16</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/0\">COSMETICS</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/1\">DRESS</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/2\">JEWELS AND PRECIOUS STONES</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000117/3\">ORNAMENTS</a>."}
