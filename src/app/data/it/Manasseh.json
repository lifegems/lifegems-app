After Joseph became Egypt&#x2019;s food administrator, Pharaoh gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, as a wife, and she bore Joseph two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

Whereas the Ephraimites had certain enclave cities in Manasseh, the Manassites were assigned enclave cities (Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor, En-dor, Taanach, and Megiddo, as well as their dependent towns) both in Issachar and Asher.

This almost precipitated civil war, as the other tribes regarded this as an act of unfaithfulness and rebellion.

This Judean king also had repair work done on the temple, the work itself being financed by contributions received from Israelites of various tribes, including Manasseh.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002882/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 34:1-11</a>.After the return from Babylonian exile (537&#xA0;B.C.E.), some Manassites resided at Jerusalem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002882/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 9:1-3</a>.In Ezekiel&#x2019;s vision, Manasseh&#x2019;s land assignment lay between Naphtali and Ephraim.

He made his sons pass through the fire, practiced magic, employed divination, and promoted spiritistic practices.
