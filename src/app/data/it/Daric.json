The obverse side of a daric that was coined for two centuries from the latter part of the sixth century B.C.E. onward depicts a king in a half-kneeling position, with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left. The reverse side shows the oblong punch impression made when the coin was stamped. At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001123/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 29:7</a> one of the figures for temple contributions during David&#x2019;s reign is stated in terms of darics, although the Persian daric was unknown in David&#x2019;s time. Evidently the writer of Chronicles converted the original figure into terms then current and familiar to his readers.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001123/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 8:27</a>.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;580]</strong>Gold daric"}
