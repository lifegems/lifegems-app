Concerning the practice of wearing such cases, or phylacteries, <em>The Jewish Encyclopedia </em>(1976, Vol.&#xA0;X, p.&#xA0;21) observes: &#x201C;The laws governing the wearing of phylacteries were derived by the Rabbis from four Biblical passages (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003861/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Deut. vi. 8</a>, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003861/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">xi. 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003861/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Ex. xiii. 9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003861/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 16</a>). While these passages were interpreted literally by most commentators, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. the Rabbis held that the general law only was expressed in the Bible, the application and elaboration of it being entirely matters of tradition and inference.&#x201D;Christ Jesus censured the scribes and Pharisees for &#x2018;broadening the scripture-containing cases that they wore as safeguards.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003861/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 23:5</a>) By enlarging these cases, they apparently wanted to give others the impression that they were very zealous and conscientious about the Law. Jesus&#x2019; words indicate that the religious leaders viewed these cases as safeguards, or charms. The Greek word <em>phy&#xB7;la&#xB7;kte&#x2B9;ri&#xB7;on, </em>in fact, primarily means an outpost, fortification, or safeguard.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003861/0\">FRONTLET BAND</a>."}
