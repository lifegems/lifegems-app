(See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/0\">HOLINESS</a>.) Words drawn from the Hebrew verb <em>qa&#xB7;dhash&#x2B9;</em> and words related to the Greek adjective <em>ha&#x2B9;gi&#xB7;os </em>are rendered &#x201C;holy,&#x201D; &#x201C;sanctified,&#x201D; &#x201C;made sacred,&#x201D; and &#x201C;set apart.&#x201D;A better understanding of the subject can be gained by a consideration of the usage of the words in the original languages. They are applied in the Scriptures to (1)&#xA0;Jehovah God, (2)&#xA0;Jesus Christ, (3)&#xA0;angels, (4)&#xA0;men and animals, (5)&#xA0;things, (6)&#xA0;periods of time or occasions, and (7)&#xA0;land possessions. Sometimes the Hebrew word for &#x201C;sanctify&#x201D; was used in the sense of preparing or making oneself ready or in fit condition. Jehovah commanded Moses to say to the complaining Israelites: &#x201C;Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, as you will certainly eat meat.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:18</a>) Before Israel crossed the Jordan River, Joshua ordered: &#x201C;Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things in your midst.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 3:5</a>) In all cases the term has a religious, spiritual, and moral sense. It can denote the getting away from anything that displeases Jehovah or appears bad in his eyes, including physical uncleanness. God said to Moses: &#x201C;Go to the people, and you must sanctify them today and tomorrow, and they must wash their mantles. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. because on the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people upon Mount Sinai.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 19:10,&#xA0;11</a>) The word is used to mean <em>purifying </em>or <em>cleansing, </em>as at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Samuel 11:4</a>, which reads: &#x201C;She was sanctifying herself from her uncleanness.&#x201D;Jehovah told Israel that they should be separate from the nations of the world and clean from their practices; he gave Israel laws to keep them set apart, including the laws defining what was clean and what was unclean for eating. Then he gave them the reason: &#x201C;For I am Jehovah your God; and you must sanctify yourselves and you must prove yourselves holy, because I am holy.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Le 11:44</a>.<strong>Jehovah God. </strong>Jehovah God is holy and absolutely clean. As the Creator and Universal Sovereign, he has the right to the exclusive worship of all of his creatures. Therefore he says that he will demonstrate his holiness, acting to sanctify himself and his name before the eyes of all creation: &#x201C;I shall certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the eyes of many nations; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 38:23</a>) Those who desire his favor, and life, must &#x201C;sanctify&#x201D; him and his name, that is, they must hold that name in its proper place as separate from and higher than all others.

But he was not received and respected by the Jewish nation as that sent one; rather, they denied his sonship and his position with his Father. He replied to them: &#x201C;Do you say to me <em>whom the Father sanctified </em>and dispatched into the world, &#x2018;You blaspheme,&#x2019; because I said, I am God&#x2019;s Son?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 10:36</a>.The apostle Peter writes to Christians, telling them to &#x201C;sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts.&#x201D; He shows that one who does this will stay away from what is bad and will do good. The people of the nations hold in their hearts an awe and a fear of men and of other things. But the Christian should set Christ in the right place in his affections and motivations. This would mean recognizing Christ&#x2019;s position as God&#x2019;s Chief Agent of life, the Messianic King, God&#x2019;s High Priest, and the one who gave his life as a ransom. He should also keep Christ&#x2019;s example of good conduct before him and hold a good conscience in connection with his own conduct as a Christian. If a person, even a ruler, should harshly demand a reason for his hope, the Christian who thus sanctifies Christ in his heart will make a good defense, yet with a mild temper and deep respect.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:10-16</a>.<span id=\"page857\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"857\" data-before-text=\"857\"></span><strong>Angels. </strong>The angels of God are called by Jesus &#x201C;holy&#x201D; angels, sanctified, set apart for Jehovah&#x2019;s holy use.

When he determined to use the males of the tribe of Levi to take care of the sacred tabernacle and its services, he said to Moses: &#x201C;As for me, look! I do take the Levites from among the sons of Israel in place of all the firstborn opening the womb of the sons of Israel; and the Levites must become mine. For every firstborn is mine. In the day that I struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified to myself every firstborn in Israel from man to beast. They should become mine. I am Jehovah.&#x201D; In order to release the firstborn of the other 11 tribes, the Israelites were required to give in exchange all the males of the tribe of Levi. Then they had to give five shekels ($11) to the sanctuary for every male firstborn above the total number of male Levites. This released the firstborn ones from being set apart for Jehovah&#x2019;s exclusive service.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 3:12, 13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> 46-48</a>.After this, all male firstborn ones opening the womb were considered to be sanctified but were presented at the temple and redeemed by a payment of five shekels ($11).

Using the word <em>sanctify </em>in the sense of <em>purify </em>or <em>cleanse </em>from sin in God&#x2019;s sight, the apostle Paul wrote: &#x201C;For if the blood of goats and of bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who have been defiled sanctifies to the extent of cleanness of the flesh, how much more will the blood of the Christ, who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works that we may render sacred service to the living God?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 9:13,&#xA0;14</a>.&#x201C;The blood of the Christ&#x201D; signifies the value of his perfect human life; and it is this that washes away the guilt of sin of the person believing in him. Hence it <em>really </em>(not just typically [compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:1-4</a>]) sanctifies to the purifying of the believer&#x2019;s flesh, from God&#x2019;s standpoint, so that the believer has a clean conscience. Also, God declares such believer righteous and makes him suitable to be one of the underpriests of Jesus Christ. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;30</a>) Such ones are called <em>ha&#x2B9;gi&#xB7;oi, </em>&#x201C;holy ones,&#x201D; &#x201C;saints&#x201D; (<em>KJ</em>), or persons sanctified to God.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 2:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> Col 1:12</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:32</a>, which refers to &#x201C;sanctified ones [<em>tois he&#xB7;gi&#xB7;a&#xB7;sme&#x2B9;nois</em>].&#x201D;So the procedure for those who are to become joint heirs with Christ is, first, that they are drawn by Jehovah God to Jesus Christ by faith in the truth of God&#x2019;s Word.

They must maintain their sanctification down to the end of their earthly course.

He would do this by setting it aside so that the produce of the land would go to the sanctuary, or he could pay over to the sanctuary the value of the land (that is, its crops) according to the estimation of the priest. If he decided to buy it back, he was required to add one fifth to the valuation of the field (governed by the number of crops until the Jubilee year) as estimated by the priest. Of course, the field would be returned to its owner at the Jubilee.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/72/0\" data-bid=\"73-1\" class=\"b\">Le 27:16-19</a>.The next verses apparently speak of the owner who does not repurchase the field but sells it to another man, and the law is that the field then becomes the permanent possession of the sanctuary at the time of the Jubilee. Concerning this law, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/73/0\" data-bid=\"74-1\" class=\"b\">Leviticus 27:20, 21</a>, Cook&#x2019;s <em>Commentary </em>says: &#x201C;[The words] may refer to a case in which a man might have fraudulently sold his interest in a field and appropriated the price after having <span id=\"page860\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"860\" data-before-text=\"860\"></span>vowed it to the Sanctuary.&#x201D; Or they may refer to a case in which a man retained the use of the field and fulfilled his vow for a while by paying as a yearly rent a due proportion of the redemption money but then later parted with his interest to another for the sake of acquiring some ready money. Such a field was considered &#x201C;devoted,&#x201D; because he treated that which was sanctified to the sanctuary as his own, disrespecting its sanctity by making merchandise of it.The principle may have been similar to the law at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/74/0\" data-bid=\"75-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>: &#x201C;You must not sow your vineyard with two sorts of seed, for fear that the full produce of the seed that you might sow and the product of the vineyard may be forfeited to the sanctuary.&#x201D; Such forfeit would result from the violation of the law stated earlier at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003827/75/0\" data-bid=\"76-1\" class=\"b\">Leviticus 19:19</a>.The distinction between things &#x201C;sanctified&#x201D; and things &#x201C;devoted&#x201D; was that the &#x201C;devoted&#x201D; thing could not be redeemed.
