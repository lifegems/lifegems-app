Defeated, the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, only to have some of their troops fall into the &#x201C;pits upon pits of bitumen&#x201D; that filled the area.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004112/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004112/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 8-10</a>.Some believe that the Low Plain of Siddim is the baylike section of the Dead Sea S of the Lisan Peninsula. They believe that it once was a fertile valley and was apparently later submerged, perhaps because of earthquake activity or because of topographical changes resulting from God&#x2019;s destruction of Sodom, Gomorrah, and the entire District.
