Much of the rift valley through which the Jordan River runs (today called the Ghor) is basically desert land.While many of the wilderness regions mentioned in the Bible are today completely barren wastelands, there is evidence that some were not always so. Denis Baly, in <em>The Geography of the Bible </em>(1957, p.&#xA0;91), says that &#x201C;the nature of the vegetation pattern must have undergone very great changes since Biblical times.&#x201D; The original well-balanced conditions on which soil, climate, and vegetation formed a stable environment, with little soil erosion, were thrown out of balance by destruction of forests that were never replanted. With shade gone, and roots no longer holding the soil, the burning summer heat and slashing winter rains destroyed it. The earth was baked by the sun, swept by the wind, flaked by extreme temperature variations, and washed away by the rains. Archaeological investigation shows that many areas now completely barren once &#x201C;included pasture lands, plains, and oases where springs and occasional rains plus careful water conservation made possible the building of villages and the maintaining of important caravan routes.&#x201D; (<em>The Interpreter&#x2019;s Dictionary of the Bible, </em>edited by G.&#xA0;Buttrick, 1962, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;828) Even today many of such wilderness areas are covered with a heavy green turf in the spring, though by the end of summer they have been burned bare by heat and drought.<span id=\"page1185\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1185\" data-before-text=\"1185\"></span><strong>Conditions in Wilderness of Wandering. </strong>Although the conditions in some of the wilderness regions were quite possibly more favorable in the ancient past than at the present time, Moses could speak of Israel&#x2019;s trek through Sinai as &#x201C;through the great and fear-inspiring wilderness, with poisonous serpents and scorpions and with thirsty ground that has no water.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004608/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">De 1:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004608/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 8:15</a>; PICTURES, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;542) It was a &#x201C;land of fevers&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004608/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 13:5</a>), a land of pit and deep shadow.

Thus, the one trusting in men rather than in Jehovah is likened to a solitary tree in a desert plain, with no hope of seeing good.
