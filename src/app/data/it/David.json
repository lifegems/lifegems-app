Of all Hebrew Scripture personages, only Moses and Abraham are mentioned more frequently by Christian Bible writers. In the 1,138 places where the name David occurs, reference is to but one individual, the second king of Israel, or the one of whom David, at times, served as a pictorial type: &#x201C;Jesus Christ, son of David.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 1:1</a>.This shepherd, musician, poet, soldier, statesman, prophet, and king stands out in the Hebrew Scriptures in great prominence. Here was a fierce fighter on the battlefield who showed endurance under hardships, a leader and commander strong and unwavering in courage, yet humble enough to acknowledge his mistakes and repent of his gross sins, a man capable of tender compassion and mercy, a lover of truth and righteousness, and above all, one with implicit trust and confidence in his God Jehovah.David, a descendant of Boaz and Ruth, had an ancestry running back through Perez to Judah.

Outdoor life prepared him to live as a fugitive when, in later life, he fled the wrath of Saul. He also acquired skill in throwing slingstones, and he developed endurance, courage, and a willingness to pursue and rescue sheep separated from the flock, not hesitating to kill a bear or a lion when necessary.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:34-36</a>.But for all of his valor as a warrior, David will also be remembered as one skilled on the harp and as a composer of song, abilities he perhaps acquired during the long hours spent tending the sheep. David also had a reputation for developing new musical instruments.

The superscriptions of no less than 73 psalms indicate that David was their composer, but still other psalms are elsewhere attributed to David. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 2:1</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 4:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 95:7, 8</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 4:7</a>.)

From following the females giving suck he brought him in to be a shepherd over Jacob his people and over Israel his inheritance.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 78:70, 71;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 7:8</a>) However, when David first left his father&#x2019;s sheep it was not to take over the kingship. Instead, he served as the court musician upon the recommendation of an adviser of Saul, who described David not only as &#x201C;skilled at playing&#x201D; but also as &#x201C;a valiant, mighty man and a man of war and an intelligent speaker and a well-formed man, and Jehovah is with him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 16:18</a>) So David became the harpist to troubled Saul, as well as his armor-bearer.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 16:19-23</a>.Later, for reasons not disclosed, David returns to his father&#x2019;s house for an indeterminate period. Upon bringing provisions to his brothers in Saul&#x2019;s army, which at the time is in a standoff position with the Philistines, he is incensed at seeing and hearing Goliath reproach Jehovah. &#x201C;Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he has to taunt the battle lines of the living God?&#x201D; David asks. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:26</a>) &#x201C;Jehovah,&#x201D; he adds, &#x201C;who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, he it is who will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:37</a>) Granted permission, the killer of the lion and the bear approaches Goliath with the words: &#x201C;I am coming to you with the name of Jehovah of armies, the God of the battle lines of Israel, whom you have taunted.&#x201D; Suddenly David hurls the stone in his sling and brings the enemy champion down. Then with Goliath&#x2019;s own sword David decapitates him, and he returns to camp with the trophies of war, the giant&#x2019;s head and sword.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:45-54</a>; PICTURE, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;745.It is noteworthy that the <em>Septuagint, </em>as it appears in the fourth-century Greek manuscript Vatican 1209, omits <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 17:55</a> through the word &#x201C;down&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">18:6a</a>.

Placed over the men of war, David was greeted with dancing and rejoicing when he returned from a victorious expedition against the Philistines, the popular song of the day being, &#x201C;Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:5-7</a>) &#x201C;All Israel and Judah were lovers of David,&#x201D; and Saul&#x2019;s own son Jonathan concluded with him a lifelong covenant of mutual love and friendship, the benefits of which extended to Jonathan&#x2019;s son Mephibosheth and grandson Mica.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:1-4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/24/2\" data-bid=\"25-3\" class=\"b\"> 20:1-42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/24/3\" data-bid=\"25-4\" class=\"b\"> 23:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/24/4\" data-bid=\"25-5\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 9:1-13</a>.This popularity stirred up envy in Saul, who kept &#x201C;looking suspiciously at David from that day forward.&#x201D; Twice when David was playing as in former times, Saul hurled a spear with the intent of pinning David to the wall, and both times Jehovah delivered him. Saul had promised to give his daughter to whoever killed Goliath, but now he was reluctant to give her to David. Finally Saul agreed to the marriage of a second daughter, provided David brought him &#x201C;a hundred foreskins of the Philistines,&#x201D; an unreasonable demand that Saul calculated would mean David&#x2019;s death. Courageous David, however, doubled the dowry, presented Saul with 200 foreskins, and was married to Michal. So now two of Saul&#x2019;s children had lovingly entered covenants with David, circumstances that made Saul hate him all the more. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:9-29</a>) When David was again playing before Saul, the king for the third time sought to pin him to the wall.

Saul continued the chase from one place to another, from the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh to the Wilderness of Maon. When Saul was about to seize his prey, word came of a Philistine raid, so for a period of time Saul abandoned the chase, allowing the fugitive to escape to En-gedi.

David, who had been hiding there in the back of the cave, crept up and cut off the skirt of Saul&#x2019;s garment but spared his life, saying that it was unthinkable on his part to harm the king, &#x201C;for he is the anointed of Jehovah.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 24:1-22</a>.<strong><em>Following Samuel&#x2019;s death. </em></strong>After Samuel&#x2019;s death, David, still in a state of exile, took up dwelling in the Wilderness of Paran.

He and his men extended kindness to Nabal, a wealthy stock raiser whose work was in Carmel, to the S of Hebron, only to be rebuffed by this ingrate. Quick thinking on the part of Nabal&#x2019;s wife Abigail stayed David&#x2019;s hand from exterminating the males of the household, but Nabal was stricken by Jehovah and died. Thereupon David married the widow, so that now, in addition to Ahinoam from Jezreel, David had yet another wife, Abigail of Carmel; during David&#x2019;s long absence, Saul had given Michal to another man.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:1-44;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> 27:3</a>.For the second time David took refuge in the Wilderness of Ziph, and again the hunt was on. David likened Saul and his 3,000 men to those searching &#x201C;for a single flea, just as one chases a partridge upon the mountains.&#x201D; One night David and Abishai crept into the sleeping camp of Saul and made off with his spear and water jug. Abishai wanted to kill Saul, but David spared Saul&#x2019;s life the second time, saying that, from Jehovah&#x2019;s viewpoint, it was unthinkable for him to thrust out his hand against God&#x2019;s anointed one.

A number of mighty men deserted Saul&#x2019;s forces and joined the exiles at Ziklag, enabling David to raid towns of Israel&#x2019;s enemies on the S, thus securing Judah&#x2019;s boundaries and strengthening his future position as king.

No doubt fearing that Bath-sheba <span id=\"page590\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"590\" data-before-text=\"590\"></span>would be publicly exposed and put to death for immoral conduct, David quickly sent word to the army that Uriah should report to him in Jerusalem, with the hope that Uriah would spend the night with his wife. But even though David got him drunk, Uriah refused to sleep with Bath-sheba. In desperation, David sent him back to the army with secret instructions to the commander Joab to have Uriah put in the front lines, where he would surely be killed. The scheme worked. Uriah died in battle, his widow observed the customary period of mourning, and then David married the widow before the townspeople were aware of her pregnancy.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 11:1-27</a>.Jehovah was watching, however, and uncovered the whole reprehensible matter. If Jehovah had permitted the case involving David and Bath-sheba to be handled by human judges under the Mosaic Law, both of the wrongdoers would have been put to death, and of course, the unborn offspring of their adultery would have died with the mother.
