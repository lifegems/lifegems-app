The area has been identified with present-day Naqb es-Safa (Ma&#x2BD;ale &#x2BD;Aqrabbim), where the road from Beer-sheba to the Arabah descends abruptly into the Wadi Murra (Nahal Zin). The name may have been derived from the abundance of scorpions in this desert country or perhaps from the way the road repeatedly curves back on itself like the tail of a scorpion. It was evidently an ancient route used to go down to Edom and S to &#x2BD;Aqaba on the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba."}
