Though neither Shalman nor Arbel are otherwise mentioned in the Bible, Hosea&#x2019;s incidental but emphatic reference to them suggests that the incident was fresh in the mind of his audience.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003935/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 10:14</a>.A building inscription of Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III refers to a prince of Moab named Salamanu, but there is no historical basis for connecting him with a despoiling in Israel.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Pritchard, 1974, p.&#xA0;282.Shalman is therefore most generally thought to be a shortened form of &#x201C;Shalmaneser,&#x201D; the name of five Assyrian kings. Shalmaneser&#xA0;V emerges as the most likely person here referred to, for toward the end of Hosea&#x2019;s period of prophesying, Shalmaneser&#xA0;V invaded Israel and laid siege to Samaria."}
