While leading Jesus to his home, Jairus surely must have been greatly encouraged by witnessing Jesus heal a woman subject for 12 years to a flow of blood. But how disheartening to receive word from messengers that his own little daughter had already died! Nonetheless, Jesus urged Jairus not to fear, but to exercise faith. Passing amid the noisy mourners who scorned and ridiculed Jesus&#x2019; remark that the child was only sleeping, Jairus, his wife, and three apostles accompanied Jesus inside, where Jesus restored the girl to life. As might be expected, Jairus and his wife were &#x201C;beside themselves with great ecstasy.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002307/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 5:21-43;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002307/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 9:18-26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002307/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 8:41-56</a>."}
