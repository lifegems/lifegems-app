The book itself sets forth its objective: &#x201C;For one to know wisdom and discipline, to discern the sayings of understanding, to receive the discipline that gives insight, righteousness and judgment and uprightness, to give to the inexperienced ones shrewdness, to a young man knowledge and thinking ability.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 1:2-4</a>) &#x201C;The purpose is that you may walk in the way of good people and that the paths of the righteous ones you may keep.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2:20</a>.The introductions to three of the book&#x2019;s sections attribute the proverbs contained in them to Solomon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 25:1</a>) This agrees with the fact that Solomon &#x201C;could speak three thousand proverbs.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:32</a>) There can be little question that many, if not all, of the proverbs in these sections were recorded during Solomon&#x2019;s reign. With reference to himself, Solomon stated: &#x201C;The congregator had become wise, he also taught the people knowledge continually, and he pondered and made a thorough search, that he might arrange many proverbs in order. The congregator sought to find the delightful words and the writing of correct words of truth.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 12:9,&#xA0;10</a>.However, various arguments have been advanced against crediting most of the proverbs to Solomon. Certain proverbs (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 16:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 20:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/5/3\" data-bid=\"6-4\" class=\"b\"> 25:3</a>) have been cited as being derogatory to monarchs and therefore not from the time of Solomon. Upon closer examination, though, it is found that, instead of being derogatory, these proverbs exalt kings, showing that they should be accorded due fear because of their power. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">24:21</a>.) Those who claim that a polygamist like Solomon would not have spoken of husband-wife relationships in such a way as to imply monogamy (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">5:15-19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 19:13,&#xA0;14</a>) lose sight of the fact that polygamy was not advocated but simply tolerated and regulated by the Law. And it may well be that the Jews generally practiced monogamy. Likewise such critics forget that Proverbs is inspired of God and is not simply the opinions of Solomon. Nevertheless, from his observations and his own experiences Solomon may very well have come to appreciate the wisdom of God&#x2019;s original standard for marriage, monogamy.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 2:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 7:27-29</a>.The proverbs not attributed to Solomon had their origin in the sayings of other wise men and one woman. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 22:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 30:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 31:1</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/0\">AGUR</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/1\">LEMUEL</a>.) Just when all these proverbs were put into final form is not precisely known. The last time indicator appearing in the book itself is a reference to Hezekiah&#x2019;s reign. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">25:1</a>) So there is a basis for <span id=\"page704\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"704\" data-before-text=\"704\"></span>believing that the proverbs were compiled in book form by the time of that ruler&#x2019;s death in c.&#xA0;717&#xA0;B.C.E. The repetition of certain proverbs suggests that the book was compiled from various separate collections.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">10:1</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">15:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:2</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">11:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> 14:20</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">19:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:2</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">21:2</a>.<strong>Style and Arrangement. </strong>The book of Proverbs is written in Hebrew poetic style, which consists of thought rhythm, employing parallelisms, the ideas of which are either similar (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 11:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/16/2\" data-bid=\"17-3\" class=\"b\"> 18:15</a>) or contrasting.

The knowledge that it strives to impart and encourage is, therefore, more than mere head knowledge, an array of facts or learning. Proverbs points out that any true knowledge has as its starting point an appreciation of one&#x2019;s relationship to Jehovah. In fact, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">chapter&#xA0;1, verse&#xA0;7</a>, the theme of the book is set forth: &#x201C;The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge.&#x201D;Of course, the most important knowledge that one can acquire is about God himself. &#x201C;The knowledge of the Most Holy One is what understanding is,&#x201D; says <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 9:10</a>. This knowledge goes beyond the mere fact of God&#x2019;s existence and his creatorship, even beyond the knowledge of many facts about his dealings. To &#x201C;know&#x201D; him denotes a deep appreciation of his fine qualities and his great name, and a close relationship with him.Jesus Christ said to Jews who had knowledge about God: &#x201C;No one fully knows the Son but the Father, neither does anyone fully know the Father but the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 11:27</a>) A knowledge of Jehovah&#x2019;s qualities will deepen one&#x2019;s proper fear of God, and it will bring the realization that Jehovah is deserving of all worship and service and that to know and obey him is the way of life. &#x201C;The fear of Jehovah is a well of life, to turn away from the snares of death,&#x201D; and, &#x201C;The fear of Jehovah tends toward life.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 14:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/34/1\" data-bid=\"35-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:23</a>.<strong><em>Jehovah the Creator. </em></strong>Jehovah, in matchless wisdom, is the Creator of all things and the Decreer of the laws governing these things; so he deserves the worship of all creatures. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 3:19,&#xA0;20</a>) He made the hearing ear and the seeing eye, both literally and in a moral sense. Accordingly, one must look to Him in order to see and hear with true understanding. And a person must realize his accountability to the One who sees and hears all.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">20:12</a>.<strong><em>Righteousness. </em></strong>The book exalts Jehovah as the center of all things and the One in whom all righteous principles find their origin. For example: &#x201C;The just indicator and scales belong to Jehovah; all the stone weights of the bag are his work.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 16:11</a>) His will as the Lawgiver is that honesty and justice rule in all transactions. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">11:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:10</a>) By fearing him, one learns to love what He loves and to hate what He hates and thereby make one&#x2019;s way of life straight, for &#x201C;the fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">8:13</a>) Proverbs reveals that Jehovah especially hates lofty eyes, a false tongue, hands shedding innocent blood, a heart fabricating hurtful schemes, feet in a hurry to run to badness, a false and lying witness, and one causing contentions among brothers. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">6:16-19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> 12:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/40/2\" data-bid=\"41-3\" class=\"b\"> 16:5</a>) One who truly <em>hates </em>these things is well on the way to life.Additionally, the book of Proverbs illuminates the way of the righteous by showing what Jehovah approves. &#x201C;The ones blameless in their way are a <em>pleasure </em>to him,&#x201D; as also are the prayers of such ones. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 11:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/41/1\" data-bid=\"42-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/41/2\" data-bid=\"42-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;29</a>) &#x201C;One that is good gets approval from Jehovah.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">12:2</a>) &#x201C;The one pursuing righteousness he loves.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">15:9</a>.<strong><em>Judgment and direction. </em></strong>One knowing Jehovah realizes through knowledge and experience that, as <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 21:30</a> says, &#x201C;there is no wisdom, nor any discernment, nor any counsel in opposition to Jehovah.&#x201D; Therefore, though he may hear other plans or have them in his own heart, the sensible person will direct his way of life in harmony with the counsel of Jehovah, knowing that contrary counsel, no matter how seemingly wise or plausible, cannot stand against the word of Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 19:21</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 23:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 5:18</a>.<span id=\"page705\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"705\" data-before-text=\"705\"></span>Inspired King Solomon said: &#x201C;Trust in Jehovah with all your heart .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.

Proverbs reminds us that Jehovah&#x2019;s eyes &#x201C;are in every place, keeping watch upon the bad ones and the good ones.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 15:3</a>) &#x201C;For the ways of man are in front of the eyes of Jehovah, and he is contemplating all his tracks.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">5:21</a>) Not only what he appears to be outwardly but also his <em>heart </em>is examined by Jehovah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">17:3</a>) &#x201C;Jehovah is making an estimate of hearts&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003569/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">21:2</a>), and He weighs the true value of the thinking, motivation, and inmost desires of the person.The judgments of Jehovah are shown to be altogether, in every respect, right and for the good of those who seek uprightness.
