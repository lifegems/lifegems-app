The Manassites, however, failed to dispossess the Canaanites from Ibleam. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002124/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:11-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002124/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:27</a>) Ibleam appears to be the same as the Bileam in Manasseh given to the Kohathite Levites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002124/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 6:70</a>) But the parallel passage mentioning Levite cities in the territory of the half tribe of Manasseh (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002124/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 21:25</a>) reads &#x201C;Gath-rimmon&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Bileam&#x201D; or &#x201C;Ibleam.&#x201D; Generally this is attributed to scribal error, &#x201C;Gath-rimmon,&#x201D; the name of a city in Dan, probably having been inadvertently repeated from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002124/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">verse&#xA0;24</a>.Ibleam has been identified with Khirbet Bel&#x2BD;ameh, about 18&#xA0;km (11&#xA0;mi) SSE of Megiddo.Near Ibleam, King Ahaziah of Judah was fatally struck down at the command of Jehu. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002124/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 9:27</a>) Later, Jehu&#x2019;s dynasty ended with the assassination of Zechariah at Ibleam (according to the Lagardian edition of the <em>LXX</em>).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002124/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 15:10-12</a>, <em>JB, NW, RS.</em>"}
