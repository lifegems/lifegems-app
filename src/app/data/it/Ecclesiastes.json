In this book he sought to congregate God&#x2019;s people away from the vain and fruitless works of this world to the works worthy of the God to whom they as a nation were dedicated. The name used in our English Bibles is taken from the translation of <em>Qo&#xB7;he&#x2B9;leth </em>in the Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>namely, <em>Ek&#xB7;kle&#xB7;si&#xB7;a&#xB7;stes&#x2B9; </em>(Ecclesiastes), meaning &#x201C;a member of an ecclesia (congregation; assembly).&#x201D;<strong>Writer. </strong>There was only one &#x201C;son of David,&#x201D; namely, Solomon, who was &#x201C;king over <em>Israel </em>in Jerusalem&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001255/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 1:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001255/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;12</a>), for kings after Solomon did not reign over all Israel.

That Solomon would be one of the best qualified men to write the book is supported by the fact that he was not only the richest but probably one of the best informed kings of his day; his sailors and tradesmen as well as visiting dignitaries would bring news and knowledge of people of other lands.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001255/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 9:26-28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001255/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:23-25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001255/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 28,&#xA0;29</a>.<strong>Authenticity. </strong><em>Qo&#xB7;he&#x2B9;leth, </em>or Ecclesiastes, is accepted as canonical by both the Jewish and the Christian churches. It is in agreement with other portions of the Bible that treat the same subjects. For example, it agrees with Genesis on man&#x2019;s being made up of a body composed of the dust of the ground and having the spirit or life-force from God and the breath that sustains it.

While some claim that the book contradicts itself, this is only because they do not see that the book many times sets forth the common view as opposed to the view that reflects divine wisdom.
