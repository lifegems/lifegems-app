(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/49/1\" data-bid=\"50-2\" class=\"b\"> 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/49/2\" data-bid=\"50-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 19:13</a>) The apostle John identified the one to whom this title belongs, namely, Jesus, he being so designated not only during his ministry on earth as a perfect man but also during his prehuman spirit existence as well as after his exaltation to heaven.<strong><em>&#x201C;The Word was a god.&#x201D; </em></strong>Regarding the Son&#x2019;s prehuman existence, John says: &#x201C;In the beginning <em>the Word </em>was, and <em>the Word </em>was with God, and <em>the Word </em>was a god.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:1</a>, <em>NW</em>) The <em>King James Version </em>and the <em>Douay Version </em>read: &#x201C;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#x201D; This would make it appear that the Word was identical with Almighty God, while the former reading, in the <em>New World Translation, </em>indicates that the Word is not <em>the </em>God, Almighty God, but is a mighty one, a god. (Even the judges of ancient Israel, who wielded great power in the nation, were called &#x201C;gods.&#x201D; [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 82:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/51/1\" data-bid=\"52-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 10:34,&#xA0;35</a>]) Actually, in the Greek text, the definite article <em>ho, </em>&#x201C;the,&#x201D; appears before the first &#x201C;God,&#x201D; but there is no article before the second.Other translations aid in getting the proper view. The interlinear word-for-word reading of the Greek translation in the <em>Emphatic Diaglott </em>reads: &#x201C;In a beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the God, and a god was the Word.&#x201D; The accompanying text of the <em>Diaglott </em>uses capital and small capital letters for <em>the </em>God, and initial capital and lowercase letters for the second appearance of &#x201C;God&#x201D; in the sentence: &#x201C;In the Beginning was the LOGOS, and the LOGOS was with GOD, and the LOGOS was God.&#x201D;These renderings would support the fact that Jesus, being the Son of God and the one used by God in creating all other things (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Col 1:15-20</a>), is indeed a &#x201C;god,&#x201D; a mighty one, and has the quality of mightiness, but is not the Almighty God. Other translations reflect this view. <em>The New English Bible </em>says: &#x201C;And what God was, the Word was.&#x201D; The Greek word translated &#x201C;Word&#x201D; is <em>Lo&#x2B9;gos; </em>and so Moffatt&#x2019;s translation reads: &#x201C;The Logos was <span id=\"page1203\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1203\" data-before-text=\"1203\"></span>divine.&#x201D; The <em>American Translation </em>reads: &#x201C;The Word was divine.&#x201D; Other readings, by German translators, follow. By B&#xF6;hmer: &#x201C;It was tightly bound up with God, yes, itself of divine being.&#x201D; By Stage: &#x201C;The Word was itself of divine being.&#x201D; By Menge: &#x201C;And God (= of divine being) the Word was.&#x201D; And by Thimme: &#x201C;And God of a sort the Word was.&#x201D; All these renderings highlight the <em>quality </em>of the Word, not his identity with his Father, the Almighty God. Being the Son of Jehovah God, he would have the divine quality, for divine means &#x201C;godlike.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Col 2:9</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 1:4</a>, where &#x201C;divine nature&#x201D; is promised to Christ&#x2019;s joint heirs.<em>The Four Gospels<wbr>&#x2014;A New Translation, </em>by Professor Charles Cutler Torrey (2nd ed., 1947), says: &#x201C;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was god. When he was in the beginning with God all things were created through him; without him came no created thing into being.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:1-3</a>) Note that what the Word is said to be is spelled without a capital initial letter, namely, &#x201C;god.&#x201D;This Word, or <em>Lo&#x2B9;gos, </em>was God&#x2019;s only direct creation, the only-begotten son of God, and evidently the close associate of God to whom God was speaking when he said: &#x201C;Let <em>us </em>make man in <em>our </em>image, according to <em>our </em>likeness.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:26</a>) Hence John continued, saying: &#x201C;This one was in the beginning with God. All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:2,&#xA0;3</a>.Other scriptures plainly show that the Word was God&#x2019;s agent through whom all other things came into existence. There is &#x201C;one God the Father, out of whom all things are, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 8:6</a>) The Word, God&#x2019;s Son, was &#x201C;the beginning of the creation by God,&#x201D; otherwise described as &#x201C;the firstborn of all creation; because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and upon the earth.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Re 3:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/59/1\" data-bid=\"60-2\" class=\"b\"> Col 1:15,&#xA0;16</a>.<strong><em>Earthly ministry and heavenly glorification. </em></strong>In due time a change came about. John explains: &#x201C;So <em>the Word </em>became flesh and resided among us [as the Lord Jesus Christ], and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:14</a>) By becoming flesh, the Word became visible, hearable, feelable to eyewitnesses on earth. In this way men of flesh could have direct contact and association with <em>&#x201C;the word </em>of life,&#x201D; which, John says, &#x201C;was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have viewed attentively and our hands felt.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 1:1-3</a>.The glorified Lord Jesus Christ continues to carry the title &#x201C;the Word,&#x201D; as noted in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 19:11-16</a>. There in a vision of heaven John says he saw a white horse whose rider was called &#x201C;Faithful and True,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Word of God&#x201D;; and &#x201C;upon his outer garment, even upon his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.&#x201D;<strong><em>Why God&#x2019;s Son is called &#x201C;the Word.&#x201D; </em></strong>A title often describes the function served or the duty performed by the bearer. So it was with the title <em>Kal-Hatz&#xE9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;the voice or word of the king,&#x201D; that was given an Abyssinian officer. Based on his travels from 1768 to 1773, James Bruce describes the duties of the <em>Kal-Hatz&#xE9; </em>as follows. He stood by a window covered with a curtain through which, unseen inside, the king spoke to this officer. He then conveyed the message to the persons or party concerned. Thus the <em>Kal-Hatz&#xE9; </em>acted as the word or voice of the Abyssinian king.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, </em>London, 1790, Vol.&#xA0;III, p.&#xA0;265; Vol.&#xA0;IV, p.&#xA0;76.Recall, too, that God made Aaron the word or &#x201C;mouth&#x201D; of Moses, saying: &#x201C;He must speak for you to the people; and it must occur that he will serve as a mouth to you, and you will serve as God to him.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004625/63/0\" data-bid=\"64-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 4:16</a>.In a similar way God&#x2019;s firstborn Son doubtless served as the Mouth, or Spokesman, for his Father, the great King of Eternity. He was God&#x2019;s Word of communication for conveying information and instructions to the Creator&#x2019;s other spirit and human sons. It is reasonable to think that prior to Jesus&#x2019; coming to earth, on many of the occasions when God communicated with humans he used the Word as his angelic mouthpiece.
