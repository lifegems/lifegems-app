During the course of the temple repair work, Hilkiah found the very &#x201C;book of Jehovah&#x2019;s law by the hand of Moses.&#x201D; What made the find outstanding was most likely the manuscript&#x2019;s being the original book written by Moses. Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan the secretary, who took the manuscript to the king. Upon hearing Shaphan read the book, King Josiah dispatched a delegation headed by High Priest Hilkiah to Huldah the prophetess to inquire of Jehovah in behalf of the king and the people.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 22:3-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 34:14</a>.<strong>5. </strong>Father of Jeremiah the prophet; a priest in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 1:1</a>.<strong>6. </strong>Father of the Gemariah whom King Zedekiah sent along with Elasah to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 29:3</a>.<strong>7. </strong>A Levite priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 12:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;7</a>.<strong>8. </strong>One of those standing at Ezra&#x2019;s right hand on the occasion of his reading the Law to the people.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 8:2-4</a>.<strong>9. </strong>The name of a priestly paternal house in the days of Nehemiah the governor.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 12:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002026/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;26</a>."}
