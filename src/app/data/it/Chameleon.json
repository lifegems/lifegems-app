(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000920/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Le 11:29,&#xA0;30</a>) The name is considered to have been derived from <em>na&#xB7;sham&#x2B9;, </em>a root word meaning &#x201C;pant.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000920/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 42:14</a>.) Koehler and Baumgartner, by a comparison with Arabic, suggest &#x201C;snorter&#x201D; as the meaning. (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;1035) While identification is uncertain, the name may apply to the chameleon. The common <em>Chamaeleo chamaeleon </em>is frequently found in Egypt and Palestine.The chameleon is a slow-moving, tree-dwelling lizard noted for its color-changing ability. Color response is primarily determined by temperature, light intensity, and emotional state.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000920/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Leviticus 11:18</a> the same Hebrew word is applied to the swan as among &#x201C;unclean&#x201D; fowl."}
