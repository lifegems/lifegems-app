The Canaanites there were not entirely dispossessed but came under forced labor. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001359/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:11-13</a>) En-dor is usually identified with Khirbet Safsafeh (Horvat Zafzafot), about 11&#xA0;km (7&#xA0;mi) SE of Nazareth.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001359/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 83:9, 10</a>, En-dor is connected with Jehovah&#x2019;s victory over Sisera. While not mentioned in the battle account at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001359/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Judges chapters&#xA0;4</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001359/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">5</a>, it evidently lay only a few miles S of Mount Tabor, from which Barak&#x2019;s army descended. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001359/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001359/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;12</a>) It was also in the general region of Taanach and Megiddo and the torrent valley of Kishon, where Sisera&#x2019;s forces were miraculously disrupted.
