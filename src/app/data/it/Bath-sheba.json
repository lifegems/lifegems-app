Thereupon David plotted to have Uriah sleep with his wife as a cover-up for the adultery, but when this scheme failed, the king had Uriah killed in battle. As soon as her mourning period was over, Bath-sheba became David&#x2019;s wife and bore the child.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 11:1-27</a>.&#x201C;But the thing .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. appeared bad in the eyes of Jehovah.&#x201D; His prophet Nathan rebuked the king with an illustration in which he represented Bath-sheba as the &#x201C;one female lamb&#x201D; of the poor man, Uriah, that the rich man, David, took to entertain a visitor. In great sorrow David repented (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ps&#xA0;51</a>), but the adulterine child, which remains nameless, died. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/0\">DAVID</a>.) Years later, further distress came to David for his sin, his own concubines being defiled by his son Absalom.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 11:27&#x2013;12:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:21,&#xA0;22</a>.Bath-sheba found comfort in her repentant husband, repeatedly addressed him as &#x201C;my lord,&#x201D; as Sarah had done to her husband (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 1:15-21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 3:6</a>), and in time she bore him a son named Solomon, whom Jehovah loved and blessed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 12:24,&#xA0;25</a>) She also had three other sons, Shimea, Shobab, and Nathan, the latter being an ancestor of Jesus&#x2019; mother Mary. Since Joseph descended from Solomon, both of Jesus&#x2019; earthly parents traced their ancestry to Bath-sheba as well as David.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 3:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 1:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/8/3\" data-bid=\"9-4\" class=\"b\"> Lu 3:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/8/4\" data-bid=\"9-5\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;31</a>.Bath-sheba comes forward in the account again toward the close of David&#x2019;s 40-year reign. David had sworn to her: &#x201C;Solomon your son is the one that will become king after me.&#x201D; So when Solomon&#x2019;s older half brother Adonijah attempted to usurp the throne just before David&#x2019;s death, Bath-sheba, on the suggestion of the prophet Nathan, reminded David of his oath. Immediately David put Solomon on the throne, and Bath-sheba thus became the queen mother.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 1:5-37</a>.After Solomon&#x2019;s throne was firmly established, Bath-sheba appeared before him as an influential intermediary with a request in behalf of Adonijah. Solomon immediately &#x201C;rose to meet her and bowed down,&#x201D; and ordered that a throne be placed for his mother, &#x201C;that she might sit at his right.&#x201D; However, her request only revealed Adonijah&#x2019;s duplicity, so Solomon had him put to death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000581/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 2:13-25</a>."}
