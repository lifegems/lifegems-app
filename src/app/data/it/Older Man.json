The latter sense is the predominant one in both the Hebrew and the Christian Greek Scriptures.The elderly man customarily was held in esteem from ancient times forward, respected for his experience and knowledge and for the wisdom and sound judgment that such may bring. In many nations people submitted themselves to the direction of their older men, either those who were the elder members of family lines or those who were notable for their qualities of knowledge and wisdom. As a result the expression &#x201C;older man&#x201D; had a double sense, applying either in a physical sense or as a designation of position or office.

As in fleshly Israel, so in spiritual Israel, the &#x201C;older men,&#x201D; or elders, were those responsible for the direction of the congregation.On the day of Pentecost, the apostles acted as a body, with Peter serving as spokesman by the operation of God&#x2019;s outpoured spirit.

At a later date, Paul went to Jerusalem and met with James and &#x201C;all the older men,&#x201D; relating to them the results of his work and receiving their counsel on certain matters.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003316/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 21:15-26</a>.In a few cases the term &#x201C;older men&#x201D; is used in contrast with younger men or in parallel with older women with no indication of congregational responsibility being involved. In such cases, the term refers simply to men of mature age.

In a few texts the &#x201C;older men&#x201D; are called &#x201C;overseers&#x201D; (Gr., <em>e&#xB7;pi&#x2B9;sko&#xB7;poi; </em>&#x2018;bishops,&#x2019; <em>KJ</em>). Paul used this term in speaking to the &#x201C;older men&#x201D; from the one congregation of Ephesus, and he applied it to such ones in his letter to Titus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003316/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003316/32/1\" data-bid=\"33-2\" class=\"b\"> 28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003316/32/2\" data-bid=\"33-3\" class=\"b\"> Tit 1:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003316/32/3\" data-bid=\"33-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;7</a>) Both terms, therefore, refer to the same position, <em>pre&#xB7;sby&#x2B9;te&#xB7;ros </em>indicating the mature qualities of the one so appointed, and <em>e&#xB7;pi&#x2B9;sko&#xB7;pos </em>the duties inherent with the appointment.Regarding the Greek word <em>pre&#xB7;sby&#x2B9;te&#xB7;ros, </em>Manuel Guerra y Gomez noted: &#x201C;The precise translation of the term [<em>pre&#xB7;sby&#x2B9;te&#xB7;ros</em>] in almost the majority of the Hellenistic texts, that have survived until now, is that of <em>older man </em>synonym of <em>mature man. </em>Maturity of judgment and guiding criterion is its distinctive note. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Whether or not it has a technical sense the term [<em>pre&#xB7;sby&#x2B9;te&#xB7;ros</em>] both in the Hellenistic and the Israelite worlds designates, not the ailing elderly, but rather the mature man, suitable by his experience and prudence for the ruling of his family or of his people.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Episcopos y Presbyteros, </em>Burgos, Spain, 1962, pp.&#xA0;117, 257.That age, in the physical sense of years lived, was a factor for qualifying to serve as an &#x201C;older man&#x201D; in ancient Israel is evident. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003316/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 12:6-13</a>) So, too, the &#x201C;older men,&#x201D; or overseers, in the Christian congregation were not young men, as is evidenced by the apostle&#x2019;s reference to their having wives and children.

Their surroundings, dress, and actions give a clue as to their identity.The apostle John had a vision of Jehovah&#x2019;s throne in heaven, surrounded by 24 lesser thrones upon which were seated 24 elders dressed in white outer garments and having golden crowns upon their heads. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003316/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Re 4:1-4</a>) As the vision continued, John saw the 24 elders not only repeatedly falling down in worship before Jehovah&#x2019;s throne but also taking part in the various features of the vision as it progressed.
