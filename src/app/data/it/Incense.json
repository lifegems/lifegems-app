The Hebrew words <em>qeto&#x2B9;reth </em>and <em>qetoh&#xB7;rah&#x2B9; </em>are from the root <em>qa&#xB7;tar&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;make sacrificial smoke.&#x201D; The equivalent in the Christian Greek Scriptures is <em>thy&#xB7;mi&#x2B9;a&#xB7;ma.</em>The sacred incense prescribed for use in the wilderness tabernacle was made of costly materials that the congregation contributed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 25:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 35:4, 5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> 27-29</a>) In giving the divine formula for this fourfold mixture, Jehovah said to Moses: &#x201C;Take to yourself perfumes: stacte drops and onycha and perfumed galbanum and pure frankincense. There should be the same portion of each. And you must make it into an incense, a spice mixture, the work of an ointment maker, salted, pure, something holy. And you must pound some of it into fine powder and put some of it before the Testimony in the tent of meeting, where I shall present myself to you. It should be most holy to you people.&#x201D; Then, to impress upon them the exclusiveness and holiness of the incense, Jehovah added: &#x201C;Whoever makes any like it to enjoy its smell must be cut off from his people.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:34-38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 37:29</a>.At a later time the rabbinic Jews added other ingredients to the temple incense, Josephus saying it was made of 13 sweet-smelling spices. (<em>The Jewish War, </em>V, 218 [v,&#xA0;5]) According to Maimonides, some of these extra items included amber, cassia, cinnamon, myrrh, saffron, and spikenard.At the W end of the Holy compartment of the tabernacle, next to the curtain dividing it off from the Most Holy, was located &#x201C;the altar of incense.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 37:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 40:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 26,&#xA0;27</a>) There was also a similar incense altar in Solomon&#x2019;s temple.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:7</a>) However, his son Eleazar was given oversight of the incense and other tabernacle items. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 4:16</a>) It appears that the burning of incense, except on the Day of Atonement, was not restricted to the high priest, as underpriest Zechariah (father of John the Baptizer) is mentioned as handling this service. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 1:8-11</a>) Soon after the tabernacle service began to function, Aaron&#x2019;s two sons Nadab and Abihu were struck dead by Jehovah for attempting to <span id=\"page1196\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1196\" data-before-text=\"1196\"></span>offer up incense with &#x201C;illegitimate fire.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Le 10:1,&#xA0;2</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:9</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/0\">ABIHU</a>.) Later, Korah and 250 others, all Levites but not of the priestly line, rebelled against the Aaronic priesthood. As a test they were instructed by Moses to take fire holders and burn incense at the tabernacle entrance so that Jehovah might indicate whether he accepted them as his priests. The group perished while in the act, their fire holders in hand.

The psalmist declared, &#x201C;May my prayer be prepared as incense before you [Jehovah].&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 141:2</a>) Likewise, the highly symbolic book of Revelation describes those around God&#x2019;s heavenly throne as having &#x201C;golden bowls that were full of incense, and the incense means the prayers of the holy ones.&#x201D; &#x201C;A large quantity of incense was given him [an angel] to offer it with the prayers of all the holy ones upon the golden altar that was before the throne.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Re 5:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> 8:3,&#xA0;4</a>) In several respects the burning incense served as a fitting symbol of the prayers of the holy ones that are &#x201C;offered up&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 5:7</a>) night and day (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 3:10</a>), and are pleasant to Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 15:8</a>.Incense, of course, could not make the prayers of false worshipers acceptable to God.

Censers are not listed among church vessels for the first four centuries of the Common Era, and not until Gregory the Great (latter part of the sixth century) is there clear evidence of incense being used in church services. Obviously, this is because with the coming of Christ and the nailing of the Law covenant and its regulations to the torture stake (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Col 2:14</a>), and especially after the temple and its Aaronic priesthood were completely removed, the burning of incense in the worship of God ceased. No authorization for its use in the Christian congregation was given, and early Christians, like the Jews, never individually burned incense for religious purposes.Early Christians also refused to burn incense in honor of the emperor, even though it cost them their lives. As Daniel P.&#xA0;Mannix observes: &#x201C;Very few of the Christians recanted, although an altar with a fire burning on it was generally kept in the arena for their convenience. All a prisoner had to do was scatter a pinch of incense on the flame and he was given a Certificate of Sacrifice and turned free. It was also carefully explained to him that he was not worshiping the emperor; merely acknowledging the divine character of the emperor as head of the Roman state. Still, almost no Christians availed themselves of the chance to escape.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Those About to Die, </em>1958, p.&#xA0;137.Tertullian (second and third centuries C.E.) says that Christians would not even engage in the incense trade. (<em>On Idolatry, </em>chap.&#xA0;XI) This, however, is not the case with the incense merchants doing business with symbolic Babylon the Great.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Re 18:11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002164/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>."}
