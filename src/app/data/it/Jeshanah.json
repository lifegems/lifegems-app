(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002439/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 13:19</a>) It is considered to be identical with the Isana referred to by Josephus as the site of Herod the Great&#x2019;s victory over General Pappus. (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>XIV, 458 [xv,&#xA0;12]) The name Isana seems to be preserved in Burj el-Isaneh, about 8&#xA0;km (5&#xA0;mi) NNE of Bethel. This place has therefore been suggested as a possible identification for ancient Jeshanah."}
