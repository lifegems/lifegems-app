Chariots with many variations of design are widely illustrated on ancient monuments, attesting to both their antiquity and their widespread use.Basically, the chariot usually consisted of a platform mounted on a single axle, with thigh-high sides; the open back of the car provided quick and easy entrance. The chariot car had a tongue and yoke harnessed to speedy horses. Often chariots were outfitted with auxiliary equipment consisting of quiver and bow cases, shields, and spears. An added menace to foot soldiers was the practice of extending iron scythes from the hubs of the wheels of some war chariots. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000923/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 17:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000923/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000923/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:19</a>) When there was only one charioteer, the reins were held around his waist or hips in battle, leaving his hands free to handle the weapons. Larger and heavier chariots with multiple spans of horses had crews of two, three, or four, with a driver and one or two fighters, and perhaps a shield-man.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000923/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 14:7</a>, ftn.Speed, maneuverability, and stability were prime factors that were improved with continued development. For example, by moving the axle toward the rear, greater maneuverability and stability were achieved. Replacing solid wheels with spoked ones lightened the weight and increased the speed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000923/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 7:33</a>) The six-spoke wheel became the most common, though some wheels were designed with four, or with eight or more. Using lightweight woods, with only the fittings of leather, bronze, or iron, made chariots light enough that one or two men could carry them over rough terrain or small streams.War chariots were employed by many of the pagan nations that opposed Israel. At the Red Sea in 1513&#xA0;B.C.E., Pharaoh&#x2019;s entire army, including his 600 special war chariots &#x201C;and all the other chariots of Egypt,&#x201D; were destroyed by Jehovah.

On one occasion the Syrians boasted that their chariots would overcome Israel if the latter could be lured out of the mountains to fight on the flat land, for, as they thought, &#x201C;[Israel&#x2019;s] God is a God of mountains.&#x201D; However, the great defeat suffered by the Syrians proved that Jehovah is also &#x201C;a God of low plains.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000923/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 20:23-30</a>.In Israel no sizable national chariot force developed until the time of Solomon. This was due in large measure to God&#x2019;s warning that the king was not to multiply horses, as if the nation&#x2019;s security depended on them. This restriction limited the use of chariots, since horses were used to power such vehicles.

There are also instances where it was used for peaceful purposes. Joseph as a food administrator of Egypt rode in a chariot of honor, second only to that of Pharaoh. In his chariot he rode out to meet his father when Jacob entered Egypt.
