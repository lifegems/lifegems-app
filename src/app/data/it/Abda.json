(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000012/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:6</a>) His son, Adoniram, was a prince over those conscripted for forced labor during David&#x2019;s, Solomon&#x2019;s, and Rehoboam&#x2019;s reigns, and is evidently the Adoram, or Hadoram, referred to in other texts.
