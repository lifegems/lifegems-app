The Greek word <em>ek&#xB7;di&#xB7;ke&#x2B9;o, </em>rendered &#x201C;avenge,&#x201D; literally means &#x201C;from justice,&#x201D; suggesting that the action represents justice achieved. As used in the Bible, &#x201C;vengeance&#x201D; usually applies to retribution paid by God in behalf of justice, but it may also refer to a person&#x2019;s executing that which he may view as just or as equalizing matters to his own satisfaction.<strong>Belongs to Jehovah. </strong>Unless a person is qualified as executioner of vengeance by appointment of Jehovah, or by being designated as such by his Word, he does wrong if he attempts to avenge himself or others. &#x201C;Vengeance is mine, and retribution,&#x201D; says Jehovah.

This is not a true bringing about of justice, but it is a desire or action as a result of people&#x2019;s hostility toward what is right and righteous, and it is an attempt to get rid of those righteous ones whose words and course of action convict them of wickedness.
