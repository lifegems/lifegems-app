To the E stretches the Wilderness of Judah, of which &#x201C;the wilderness of Tekoa&#x201D; (where the Ammonites, Moabites, and the forces from Mount Seir suffered a crushing defeat during Jehoshaphat&#x2019;s reign) was apparently a part.

It was the home of Ikkesh, the father of Ira, one of David&#x2019;s mighty men.
