(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;22</a>) In Arabic it is called Jebel et-Tur; in Hebrew, Har Tavor. It is situated about 20&#xA0;km (12&#xA0;mi) W of the <span id=\"page1061\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1061\" data-before-text=\"1061\"></span>southern end of the Sea of Galilee and about 8&#xA0;km (5&#xA0;mi) ESE of the city of Nazareth.Isolated from other mountains, Tabor rises abruptly from the Valley of Jezreel to an altitude of about 562&#xA0;m (1,844&#xA0;ft) above sea level. From the WNW it looks like a truncated cone, and from the SW like the segment of a sphere. From its summit, a rather flat elliptic area about 0.4&#xA0;km (0.25 mi) wide from N to S and twice as long from E to W, it affords a magnificent view in all directions. The impressive prominence of this mountain probably explains why the psalmist mentions Tabor and Mount Hermon together as outstanding examples of the Creator&#x2019;s majestic craftsmanship. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 89:12</a>) Jehovah also used the striking massiveness of Tabor<wbr>&#x2014;standing alone in the Valley of Jezreel&#x2014;<wbr>to illustrate the impressiveness of Nebuchadnezzar upon his entering Egypt with a mighty military force.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 46:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;18</a>.Tabor was made particularly famous when Barak, at God&#x2019;s direction, assembled 10,000 men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun against Sisera and his army, which included 900 chariots with &#x201C;iron scythes.&#x201D; At the given signal Barak and his forces hurried down the slopes of Tabor, and after Jehovah had thrown the Canaanites into confusion, the Israelites won a decisive victory over the fleeing forces of Sisera.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:4-16</a>.Some years later Tabor witnessed the killing of Gideon&#x2019;s brothers by Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 8:18,&#xA0;19</a>) By the middle of the eighth century B.C.E., the unfaithful priestly and regal houses of Israel were &#x201C;as a net spread over Tabor,&#x201D; possibly using that mountain W of the Jordan as a center for idolatry to snare the Israelites; Mizpah may have been so used E of the Jordan.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 5:1</a>.The summit of Tabor provided a commanding position and a most suitable location for a fortified city. The ruins show that such a city flourished there before and after the first century C.E. This fact gives reason to question the tradition that Tabor was the location of Jesus&#x2019; transfiguration, for the accounts say that Jesus and his three companions were in the mountain &#x201C;by themselves,&#x201D; &#x201C;to themselves alone.&#x201D; Mount Hermon is more likely that &#x201C;lofty mountain,&#x201D; and it is near Caesarea Philippi at the headwaters of the Jordan, where Jesus had been shortly before the transfiguration.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 17:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 8:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:2</a>.<strong>2. </strong>One of the cities in the territory of Zebulun given to the Levitical sons of Merari. Today its location is unknown.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 6:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;77</a>.<strong>3. </strong>&#x201C;The big tree of Tabor&#x201D; was presumably in Benjamin&#x2019;s territory. It was a landmark that Samuel referred to in his instructions to Saul after Saul&#x2019;s anointing, where he was to meet three men en route to Bethel. The site is unknown today.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004298/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 10:1-3</a>.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;1061]</strong>Mount Tabor rises abruptly from the Valley of Jezreel"}
