However, the Greek word for &#x201C;needle&#x201D; found at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003208/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 19:24 and</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003208/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Mark 10:25</a> (<em>rha&#xB7;phis&#x2B9;</em>) is drawn from a verb meaning &#x201C;sew.&#x201D; Also, the Greek word appearing in the parallel passage of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003208/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 18:25</a> (<em>be&#xB7;lo&#x2B9;ne</em>) is used to refer to a literal surgical needle. Regarding these Greek terms <em>Vine&#x2019;s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words </em>notes: &#x201C;The idea of applying &#x2018;the needle&#x2019;s eye&#x2019; to small gates seems to be a modern one; there is no ancient trace of it. The Lord&#x2019;s object in the statement is to express human impossibility and there is no need to endeavour to soften the difficulty by taking the needle to mean anything more than the ordinary instrument.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;1981, Vol.&#xA0;3, p.&#xA0;106.As a hyperbole, the illustration emphasized how difficult it would be for rich men not simply to begin serving God but actually to enter into the Kingdom.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003208/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 6:17-19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003208/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 13:24</a>."}
