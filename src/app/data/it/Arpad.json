Arpad has been identified with Tell Erfad (Tell Rif&#x2BD;at) about 30&#xA0;km (19&#xA0;mi) NNW of Aleppo. Situated on the road leading S to Hamath and Damascus, it came under frequent attack from the Assyrians and was eventually conquered by Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III and later by Sargon&#xA0;II. Thus Sargon&#x2019;s son, Sennacherib, when threatening Jerusalem in 732&#xA0;B.C.E., had his spokesman Rabshakeh refer to the fate of Arpad as an evidence of the inability of the gods of the nations to resist Assyria&#x2019;s mighty power.
