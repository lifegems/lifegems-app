(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001658/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:19</a>) In the past Gerar was commonly linked with Tell Jemmeh (Tel Gamma), about 12&#xA0;km (7.5 mi) S of modern Gaza. But currently it is identified by numerous geographers <span id=\"page925\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"925\" data-before-text=\"925\"></span>with Tell Abu Hureirah (Tel Haror), located in the foothills of the mountains of Judea, about 19&#xA0;km (12&#xA0;mi) SE of modern Gaza. Many earthenware fragments believed to date from the time of the patriarchs have been found at the site. Abraham and, later, Isaac resided for a time as aliens at Gerar and dealt with its king Abimelech (possibly two different rulers that bore this name or official title).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001658/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 20:1-18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001658/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:22-34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001658/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 26:1-31</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001658/0\">ABIMELECH</a> Nos.&#xA0;1 and&#xA0;2.After Jehovah brought about the defeat of the impressive army of Zerah the Ethiopian, King Asa&#x2019;s forces pursued the fleeing enemy as far as Gerar.
