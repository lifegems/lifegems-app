Having come to be past all moral sense, they gave themselves over to loose conduct to work uncleanness of every sort with greediness.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002770/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 4:17-19</a>.Nevertheless, some claiming to be servants of God and Christ turn from the way of light and display a brazen, defiant attitude toward divine law and authority. Paul was grieved by those in the Corinthian congregation who had not repented of the &#x201C;uncleanness and fornication and loose conduct that they [had] practiced,&#x201D; in spite of admonition to the contrary. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002770/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 12:21</a>) Peter warned the early Christians that false teachers would come from among their own ranks and that many would follow their acts of loose conduct, bringing reproach upon the way of truth.

But Jesus&#x2019; half brother Jude spoke of such as being &#x201C;ungodly men, turning the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct and proving false to our only Owner and Lord, Jesus Christ.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002770/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Jude&#xA0;4</a>) Such ones&#x2019; profession of Christianity is meaningless. Their service is unacceptable to God; it is as the wise writer of Israel said: &#x201C;The sacrifice of the wicked ones is something detestable. How much more so when one brings it along with loose conduct.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002770/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 21:27</a>.Under the Law, the same viewpoint was expressed against loose conduct. God has not changed on this matter. Loose conduct was legislated against, and the penalty was death.
