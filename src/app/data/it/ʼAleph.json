It is transliterated in writing by a raised comma (&#x2BC;). As pronounced in Hebrew it is the softest of guttural sounds (that is, sounds pronounced in the throat) <span id=\"page70\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"70\" data-before-text=\"70\"></span>and is like the slight guttural sound given to the silent &#x201C;h&#x201D; at the beginning of the English word &#x201C;hour,&#x201D; or like with the second &#x201C;o&#x201D; in &#x201C;cooperate.&#x201D;In the Hebrew, the first eight verses in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000191/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 119</a> begin with <em>&#x2BC;a&#x2B9;leph.</em>"}
