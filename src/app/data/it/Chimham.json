When the aged Barzillai declined the invitation to become part of King David&#x2019;s court and recommended that Chimham go in his place, David replied: &#x201C;With me Chimham will go across [the Jordan], and I myself shall do to him what is good in your eyes; and all that you may choose to lay upon me I shall do for you.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000957/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 19:33,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000957/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 37-40</a>) Apparently Chimham remained in the royal court, as is indicated by <span id=\"page437\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"437\" data-before-text=\"437\"></span>David&#x2019;s final instructions to Solomon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000957/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 2:7</a>) Reference is made at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000957/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 41:17</a> to &#x201C;the lodging place of Chimham&#x201D; near Bethlehem. It is not known whether this refers to the Chimham of David&#x2019;s time or to a later man by the same name. Some commentators say that Chimham may have been given a tract of land for his services to David, or that it was a place where Chimham had built a lodging place for travelers."}
