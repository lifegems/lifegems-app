Reaching a certain fountain (Heb., <em>&#x2BD;a&#x2B9;yin</em>), however, she was reassured by an angel, instructed to return to her mistress, and told of the birth and future of Ishmael (whose name means &#x201C;God Hears (Listens)&#x201D;). Therefore, the well there was called &#x201C;Beer-lahai-roi,&#x201D; Hagar saying of Jehovah, &#x201C;You are a God of sight.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000611/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 16:7-14</a>.Later, Isaac was coming from &#x201C;the way that goes to Beer-lahai-roi&#x201D; in the Negeb when he caught sight of the camel caravan bringing his future bride, Rebekah.

But the absence of any clear identification of Bered leaves the identification uncertain."}
