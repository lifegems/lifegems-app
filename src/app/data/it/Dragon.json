It occurs 13 times in the Bible but only in the highly symbolic book of Revelation, and it represents Satan the Devil. He is the &#x201C;great fiery-colored dragon, with seven heads and ten horns,&#x201D; having a tail that draws &#x201C;a third of the stars of heaven&#x201D; after him, these first being induced to materialize as humans before the Flood and then becoming demons.
