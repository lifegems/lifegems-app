(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001872/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge&#xA0;24</a>) Later, Jacob, Abraham&#x2019;s grandson, went to Haran to escape the wrath of his brother Esau and also to find a wife among the daughters of his uncle Laban.

(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001872/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:23</a>.) The name of the ancient city is preserved in modern Haran, situated where two wadis join to form a stream that reaches the Balikh River in the winter, about 110&#xA0;km (68&#xA0;mi) above where the Balikh empties into the Euphrates River. But some believe that the ancient site itself lies to the N of modern Haran. Certain scholars see evidence for patriarchal residence (as described in the Bible) in the correspondency of ancient place-names <span id=\"page1035\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1035\" data-before-text=\"1035\"></span>in this area to such personal names as Serug, Nahor, and Terah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001872/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:22-26</a>.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;1034]</strong>Present-day Haran preserves the name of the ancient city at or near which Abraham&#x2019;s servant found a wife for Isaac"}
