(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 17:2-6</a>.) In most cases where the context shows that either word has the thought of &#x201C;tribe,&#x201D; it is used in regard to one of the tribes of Israel, such as &#x201C;the tribe [<em>mat&#xB7;teh&#x2B9;</em>] of Gad&#x201D; or &#x201C;the tribe [<em>she&#x2B9;vet</em>] of the Levites.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;33</a>) However, the &#x2018;tribe that God redeemed as his inheritance,&#x2019; mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 74:2</a>, evidently refers to the entire nation of Israel, speaking of it as a &#x201C;tribe&#x201D; or people distinct from other nations and peoples.

The word is often used in the Christian Greek Scriptures in regard to the tribes of the nation of Israel.

In Ezekiel&#x2019;s vision of the holy contribution and the 12 tribes, the tribes listed are the same as those who received a land inheritance as given in the book of Joshua.

Though the tribe was the basic and most important division of the nation, each tribe was subdivided into large &#x201C;families&#x201D; (with &#x201C;family&#x201D; used in a broad sense) based on descent from paternal heads. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 3:20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> 24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/23/2\" data-bid=\"24-3\" class=\"b\"> 34:14</a>) Within each &#x201C;family&#x201D; there were many individual households. This arrangement, patterned after the tribal structure, is well illustrated in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 7:16-18</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 9:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:20,&#xA0;21</a>.<strong>Tribes of Spiritual Israel. </strong><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 7:4-8</a> divides the 144,000 members of spiritual Israel into 12 &#x2018;tribes&#x2019; of 12,000 each. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/2\">ISRAEL OF GOD</a>.) The list differs slightly from the lists of Jacob&#x2019;s sons (including Levi) who were the tribal heads of natural Israel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:28</a>) The following may be the reason for the difference:Jacob&#x2019;s firstborn son Reuben lost his right as firstborn by his misconduct.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 48:21,&#xA0;22</a>) In the Revelation list &#x201C;Joseph&#x201D; evidently stands for Ephraim. And Manasseh represents Joseph&#x2019;s second portion in spiritual Israel. The tribe of Levi is listed; to make room for Levi without increasing the number of tribes, no tribe of Dan is included in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 7:4-8</a>, but apparently not because of any unsuitability on Dan&#x2019;s part. The inclusion of Levi would also serve to show that there is no special priestly tribe in spiritual Israel, the entire spiritual nation being &#x201C;a royal priesthood.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 2:9</a>.<strong>&#x201C;Judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel.&#x201D; </strong>Jesus told the apostles that in &#x201C;the re-creation&#x201D; they would &#x201C;sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 19:28</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/3\">CREATION</a> [Re-Creation].)
