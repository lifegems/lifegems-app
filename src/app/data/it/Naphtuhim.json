Assuming the name to derive from some geographic relationship, scholars often associate Naphtuhim with an Egyptian phrase meaning &#x201C;those of the Delta,&#x201D; and on this basis the Naphtuhim are included among the inhabitants of Lower (northern) Egypt. The correctness of these views is not as yet conclusive."}
