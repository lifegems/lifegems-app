Various Hebrew terms denoting such a one are <em>kesil&#x2B9; </em>(&#x2018;stupid one&#x2019;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 1:22</a>), <em>&#x2BC;ewil&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;foolish one&#x201D;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 12:15</a>), <em>na&#xB7;val&#x2B9; </em>(&#x2018;senseless one&#x2019;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 17:7</a>), and <em>lets </em>(&#x201C;ridiculer&#x201D;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 13:1</a>). The Greek <em>a&#x2B9;phron </em>refers to an &#x201C;unreasonable one&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 12:20</a>), <em>a&#xB7;no&#x2B9;e&#xB7;tos </em>to one &#x201C;senseless&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 3:1</a>), and <em>mo&#xB7;ros&#x2B9; </em>to a &#x2018;fool&#x2019; or &#x201C;foolish&#x201D; one (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 23:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 25:2</a>).The course of the man Nabal illustrates the way of a fool (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa&#xA0;25</a>) as does that of people who know the true God and then worship created things. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 1:20-25</a>) Isaiah said a fool, or senseless person, will speak &#x201C;mere senselessness, and his very heart will work at what is hurtful, to work at apostasy and to speak against Jehovah what is wayward, to cause the soul of the hungry one to go empty, and he causes even the thirsty one to go without drink itself.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 32:6</a>) The fool despises wisdom and discipline.

Moreover, Jesus backed up the correctness of this designation by illustrating their lack of discernment. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 23:15-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:3</a>) However, the individual wrongly calling a brother a &#x201C;despicable fool,&#x201D; judging and condemning his brother as being morally worthless, would make himself liable to Gehenna.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 14:10-12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/15/2\" data-bid=\"16-3\" class=\"b\"> Mt 7:1,&#xA0;2</a>.The foolish man who built his house upon the sand and the rich man whose land was producing well, and who therefore planned to expand his storage facilities and then really enjoy life, are examples of Jesus&#x2019; fine illustrations from daily life highlighting the foolishness of neglecting spiritual things and thereby missing out on the real blessing. Moreover, failing to &#x201C;keep on the watch&#x201D; in a spiritual way is folly, as is emphasized by Jesus&#x2019; illustration of the five foolish virgins who, in going out to meet the bridegroom, took no oil with them for their lamps.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:24-27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 12:16-21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/16/2\" data-bid=\"17-3\" class=\"b\"> Mt 25:1-13</a>.To become truly wise, a person must become a fool in the eyes of the world, &#x201C;for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.&#x201D; It is not the worldly wise but those looked down upon as persons without knowledge, fools, whom Jehovah has chosen to represent him. This has resulted in making the foolishness of this world even more apparent. Furthermore, this removes all reason for boasting on the part of the favored individual. Instead, all glory goes rightfully to the Source of wisdom, Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 3:18, 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> 1:18-31</a>.Answering a fool in harmony with or &#x201C;according to his foolishness&#x201D; in the sense of resorting to his degrading methods of argument puts the one so doing in agreement with the fool&#x2019;s unsound reasonings or ways. In order not to become like the fool in this respect, we are counseled by the proverb: &#x201C;Do not answer anyone stupid according to his foolishness.&#x201D; On the other hand, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001543/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 26:4, 5</a> shows that answering him &#x201C;according to his foolishness&#x201D; in the sense of analyzing his contentions, exposing them as being ridiculous, and showing that his own arguments lead to entirely different conclusions from those he has drawn can be beneficial."}
