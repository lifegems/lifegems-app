The meaning of the name Oholibah seems to allude to the fact that Jehovah&#x2019;s tent, or sanctuary, was in her territory. (Compare <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003311/0\">OHOLAH</a>.) However, instead of appreciating this and taking to heart the punishment that came upon her sister Oholah (Samaria) for unfaithfulness, Oholibah not only continued the record of infidelity begun in Egypt but conducted herself even worse than her sister. She practiced idolatry on a large scale and became politically involved with the Assyrians and the Babylonians. Consequently her former lovers, the Babylonians, were foretold to come against her and make her &#x201C;a frightful object.&#x201D;"}
