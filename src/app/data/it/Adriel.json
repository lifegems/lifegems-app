{"title":"Adriel","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000121","html":"<span id=\"page52\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"52\" data-before-text=\"52\"></span><strong>ADRIEL</strong>(A&#x2B9;dri&#xB7;el).The son of Barzillai, from the city of Abel-meholah.Adriel was given Saul&#x2019;s oldest daughter Merab as wife, though she had previously been promised to David. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000121/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:17-19</a>) All of Adriel&#x2019;s five sons were later surrendered for execution to help atone for Saul&#x2019;s attempted annihilation of the Gibeonites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000121/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 21:8,&#xA0;9</a>) In this account Michal rather than Merab is spoken of as the mother of Adriel&#x2019;s five sons. Since Michal died childless (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000121/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 6:23</a>) and is nowhere spoken of as having been the wife of Adriel, some translators view the appearance of Michal&#x2019;s name as a scribal error. Nearly all Hebrew manuscripts, however, use Michal&#x2019;s name, and the traditional explanation is that Merab, Michal&#x2019;s older sister, died early after having borne five sons to Adriel and that Michal thereafter undertook the bringing up of her sister&#x2019;s five boys, thus resulting in their being spoken of as her sons. Isaac Leeser&#x2019;s translation reads at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000121/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Samuel 21:8</a>: &#x201C;And the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she had brought up for Adriel.&#x201D;"}
