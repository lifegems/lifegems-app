(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Hab 2:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 13:15</a>.) They can also mean <em>wind; </em>the <em>vital force </em>in living creatures; <em>one&#x2019;s spirit; spirit persons, </em>including God and his angelic creatures; and <em>God&#x2019;s active force, </em>or <em>holy spirit. </em>(Compare Koehler and Baumgartner&#x2019;s <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, pp.&#xA0;877-879; Brown, Driver, and Briggs&#x2019; <em>Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, </em>1980, pp.&#xA0;924-926; <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, </em>edited by G.&#xA0;Friedrich, translated by G.&#xA0;Bromiley, 1971, Vol.&#xA0;VI, pp.&#xA0;332-451.) All these meanings have something in common: They all refer to that which is invisible to human sight and which gives evidence of force in motion. Such invisible force is capable of producing visible effects.Another Hebrew word, <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:7</a>), also means &#x201C;breath,&#x201D; but it is more limited in range of meaning than <em>ru&#x2B9;ach. </em>The Greek <em>pno&#xB7;e&#x2B9; </em>seems to have a similar limited sense (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 17:25</a>) and was used by the <em>Septuagint </em>translators to render <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;.</em><strong>Wind. </strong>Consider first the sense that is perhaps easiest to grasp.

The Scriptures themselves unite to show that God&#x2019;s holy spirit is not a person but is God&#x2019;s <em>active force </em>by which he accomplishes his purpose and executes his will.It may first be noted that the words &#x201C;in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one&#x201D; (<em>KJ</em>) found in older translations at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;John 5:7</a> are actually spurious additions to the original text.

It states that the passage is first found in a treatise entitled <em>Liber Apologeticus, </em>of the fourth century, and that it appears in Old Latin and Vulgate manuscripts of the Scriptures, beginning in the sixth century. Modern translations as a whole, both Catholic and Protestant, do not include them in the main body of the text, because of recognizing their spurious nature.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>RS, NE, NAB.</em><strong><em>Personification does not prove personality. </em></strong>It is true that Jesus spoke of the holy spirit as a &#x201C;helper&#x201D; and spoke of such helper as &#x2018;teaching,&#x2019; &#x2018;bearing witness,&#x2019; &#x2018;giving evidence,&#x2019; &#x2018;guiding,&#x2019; &#x2018;speaking,&#x2019; &#x2018;hearing,&#x2019; and &#x2018;receiving.&#x2019; In so doing, the original Greek shows Jesus at times applying the masculine personal pronoun to that &#x201C;helper&#x201D; (paraclete).

(<em>KJ, RS, JP, AT</em>) Wisdom is also personified at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 11:19</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 7:35</a>, where it is depicted as having both &#x201C;works&#x201D; and &#x201C;children.&#x201D; The apostle Paul personalized sin and death and also undeserved kindness as &#x201C;kings.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> 17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/38/2\" data-bid=\"39-3\" class=\"b\"> 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/38/3\" data-bid=\"39-4\" class=\"b\"> 6:12</a>) He speaks of sin as &#x201C;receiving an inducement,&#x201D; &#x2018;working out covetousness,&#x2019; &#x2018;seducing,&#x2019; and &#x2018;killing.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 7:8-11</a>) Yet it is obvious that Paul did not mean that sin was actually a person.So, likewise with John&#x2019;s account of Jesus&#x2019; words regarding the holy spirit, his remarks must be taken in context. Jesus personalized the holy spirit when speaking of that spirit as a &#x201C;helper&#x201D; (which in Greek is the masculine substantive <em>pa&#xB7;ra&#x2B9;kle&#xB7;tos</em>). Properly, therefore, John presents Jesus&#x2019; words as referring to that &#x201C;helper&#x201D; aspect of the spirit with masculine personal pronouns. On the other hand, in the same context, when the Greek <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma </em>is used, John employs a neuter pronoun to refer to the holy spirit, <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma </em>itself being neuter. Hence, we have in John&#x2019;s use of the masculine personal pronoun in association with <em>pa&#xB7;ra&#x2B9;kle&#xB7;tos </em>an example of conformity to grammatical rules, not an expression of doctrine.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:16, 17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:7,&#xA0;8</a>.<strong><em>Lacks personal identification. </em></strong>Since God himself is a Spirit and is holy and since all his faithful angelic sons are spirits and are holy, it is evident that if the &#x201C;holy spirit&#x201D; were a person, there should reasonably be given some means in the Scriptures to distinguish and identify such spirit <em>person </em>from all these other &#x2018;holy spirits.&#x2019; It would be expected that, at the very least, the definite article would be used with it in all cases where it is not called &#x201C;God&#x2019;s holy spirit&#x201D; or is not modified by some similar expression. This would at least distinguish it as THE Holy Spirit. But, on the contrary, in a large number of cases the expression &#x201C;holy spirit&#x201D; appears in the original Greek without the article, thus indicating its lack of personality.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 6:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/1\" data-bid=\"42-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/2\" data-bid=\"42-3\" class=\"b\"> 7:55;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/3\" data-bid=\"42-4\" class=\"b\"> 8:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/4\" data-bid=\"42-5\" class=\"b\"> 17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/5\" data-bid=\"42-6\" class=\"b\"> 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/6\" data-bid=\"42-7\" class=\"b\"> 9:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/7\" data-bid=\"42-8\" class=\"b\"> 11:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/8\" data-bid=\"42-9\" class=\"b\"> 13:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/9\" data-bid=\"42-10\" class=\"b\"> 52;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/10\" data-bid=\"42-11\" class=\"b\"> 19:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/11\" data-bid=\"42-12\" class=\"b\"> Ro 9:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/12\" data-bid=\"42-13\" class=\"b\"> 14:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/13\" data-bid=\"42-14\" class=\"b\"> 15:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/14\" data-bid=\"42-15\" class=\"b\"> 16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/15\" data-bid=\"42-16\" class=\"b\"> 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/16\" data-bid=\"42-17\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 12:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/17\" data-bid=\"42-18\" class=\"b\"> Heb 2:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/18\" data-bid=\"42-19\" class=\"b\"> 6:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/19\" data-bid=\"42-20\" class=\"b\"> 2Pe 1:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/41/20\" data-bid=\"42-21\" class=\"b\"> Jude&#xA0;20</a>, <em>Int </em>and other interlinear translations.<strong><em>How baptized in its &#x201C;name.&#x201D; </em></strong>At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 28:19</a> reference is made to &#x201C;the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.&#x201D; A &#x201C;name&#x201D; can mean something other than a personal name.

(<em>RS, AT, JB, NW</em>) Thus, Robertson&#x2019;s <em>Word Pictures in the New Testament </em>(1930, Vol.&#xA0;I, p.&#xA0;245) says on <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 28:19</a>: &#x201C;The use of name (<em>onoma</em>) here is a common one in the Septuagint and the papyri for power or authority.&#x201D; Hence baptism &#x2018;in the name of the holy spirit&#x2019; implies recognition of that spirit as having its source in God and as exercising its function according to the divine will.<strong><em>Other evidence of its impersonal nature. </em></strong>Further evidence against the idea of personality as regards the holy spirit is the way it is used in association with other impersonal things, such as water and fire (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 3:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/45/1\" data-bid=\"46-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 1:8</a>); and Christians are spoken of as being baptized &#x201C;in holy spirit.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:16</a>) Persons are urged to become &#x201C;filled with spirit&#x201D; instead of with wine.

While some texts refer to the spirit as &#x2018;witnessing,&#x2019; &#x2018;speaking,&#x2019; or &#x2018;saying&#x2019; things, other texts make clear that it spoke through persons, having no personal voice of its own.

It may thus be compared to radio waves that can transmit a message from a person speaking into a microphone and cause his voice to be heard by persons a distance away, in effect, &#x2018;speaking&#x2019; the message by a radio loudspeaker. God, by his spirit, transmits his messages and communicates his will to the minds and hearts of his servants on earth, who, in turn, may convey that message to yet others.<strong><em>Distinguished from &#x201C;power.&#x201D; </em></strong><em>Ru&#x2B9;ach </em>and <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma, </em>therefore, when used with reference to God&#x2019;s holy spirit, refer to God&#x2019;s invisible active force by which he accomplishes his divine purpose and will.

Ru&#x2B9;ach </em>and <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma </em>are used in close association or even in parallel with these terms signifying &#x201C;power,&#x201D; which shows that there is an inherent connection between them and yet a definite distinction.

Regarding the planet Earth in its early formative stages, the record states that &#x201C;God&#x2019;s active force [or &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; (<em>ru&#x2B9;ach</em>)] was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:2</a>) <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 33:6</a> says: &#x201C;By the word of Jehovah the heavens themselves were made, and by the spirit of his mouth all their army.&#x201D; Like a powerful breath, God&#x2019;s spirit can be sent forth to exert power even though there is no bodily contact with that which is acted upon.

Where a human craftsman would use the force of his hands and fingers to produce things, God uses his spirit.

The record at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/150/0\" data-bid=\"151-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 2:7</a> uses <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9; </em>in describing God&#x2019;s causing Adam&#x2019;s body to have life so that the man became &#x201C;a living soul.&#x201D; Other texts, however, show that more was involved than simple breathing of air, that is, more than the mere introduction of air into the lungs and its expulsion therefrom. Thus, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/151/0\" data-bid=\"152-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 7:22</a>, in describing the destruction of human and animal life outside the ark at the time of the Flood, we read: &#x201C;Everything in which the breath [form of <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;</em>] of the force [or, &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; (<em>ru&#x2B9;ach</em>)] of life was active in its nostrils, namely, all that were on the dry ground, died.&#x201D; <em>Nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;, </em>&#x201C;breath,&#x201D; is thus directly associated or linked with <em>ru&#x2B9;ach, </em>which here describes the spirit, or life-force, that is active in all living creatures<wbr>&#x2014;human and animal souls.As the <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament </em>(Vol.&#xA0;VI, p.&#xA0;336) states: &#x201C;Breath may be discerned only in movement [as in the movement of the chest or the expanding of the nostrils], and it is also a sign, condition and agent of life, which seems to be esp[ecially] tied up with breathing.&#x201D; Hence, the <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;, </em>or &#x201C;breath,&#x201D; is both the product of the <em>ru&#x2B9;ach, </em>or life-force, and also a principal means of sustaining that life-force in living creatures. It is known from scientific studies, for example, that life is present in every single cell of the body&#x2019;s one hundred trillion cells and that, while thousands of millions of cells die each minute, constant reproduction of new living cells goes on. The life-force active in all the living cells is dependent upon the oxygen that breathing brings into the body, which oxygen is transported to all the cells by the bloodstream. Without oxygen some cells begin to die after several minutes, others after a longer period. While a person can go without breathing for a few minutes and still survive, without the <em>life-force </em>in his cells he is dead beyond all human ability to revive him. The Hebrew Scriptures, inspired by man&#x2019;s Designer and Creator, evidently use <em>ru&#x2B9;ach </em>to denote this vital force that is the very principle of life, and <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9; </em>to represent the breathing that sustains it.Because breathing is so inseparably connected with life, <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9; </em>and <em>ru&#x2B9;ach </em>are used in clear parallel in various texts. Job voiced his determination to avoid unrighteousness &#x201C;while my breath [form of <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;</em>] is yet whole within me, and the spirit [<em>weru&#x2B9;ach</em>] of God is in my nostrils.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/152/0\" data-bid=\"153-1\" class=\"b\">Job 27:3-5</a>) Elihu said: &#x201C;If that one&#x2019;s spirit [form of <em>ru&#x2B9;ach</em>] and breath [form of <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;</em>] he [God] gathers to himself, all flesh will expire [that is, &#x201C;breathe out&#x201D;] together, and earthling man himself will return to the very dust.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/153/0\" data-bid=\"154-1\" class=\"b\">Job 34:14,&#xA0;15</a>) Similarly, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/154/0\" data-bid=\"155-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 104:29</a> says of earth&#x2019;s creatures, human and animal: &#x201C;If you [God] take away their spirit, they expire, and back to their dust they go.&#x201D; At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/155/0\" data-bid=\"156-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 42:5</a> Jehovah is spoken of as &#x201C;the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it.&#x201D; The breath (<em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;</em>) sustains their existence; the spirit (<em>ru&#x2B9;ach</em>) energizes and is the life-force that enables man to be an animated creature, to move, walk, be actively alive.

However, when such &#x201C;wind,&#x201D; which is simply air in motion, entered the nostrils of the dead persons of the vision, it became &#x201C;breath,&#x201D; which is also air in motion. Thus, the rendering of <em>ru&#x2B9;ach </em>as &#x201C;breath&#x201D; at this point of the account (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/160/0\" data-bid=\"161-1\" class=\"b\">vs 10</a>) is also more appropriate than &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; or &#x201C;life-force.&#x201D; Ezekiel also would be able to see the bodies begin to breathe, even though he could not see the life-force, or spirit, energizing their bodies. As <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/161/0\" data-bid=\"162-1\" class=\"b\">verses 11-14</a> show, this vision was symbolic of a spiritual (not physical) revivification of the people of Israel who were for a time in a spiritually dead state due to their Babylonian exile. Since they were already physically alive and breathing, it is logical to render <em>ru&#x2B9;ach </em>as &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/162/0\" data-bid=\"163-1\" class=\"b\">verse 14</a>, where God states that he will put &#x2018;his spirit&#x2019; in his people so that they would become alive, spiritually speaking.A similar symbolic vision is given at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/163/0\" data-bid=\"164-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation chapter&#xA0;11</a>. The picture is presented of &#x201C;two witnesses&#x201D; who are killed and whose corpses are allowed to lie on the street for three and a half days. Then &#x201C;spirit [or breath, <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma</em>] of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/164/0\" data-bid=\"165-1\" class=\"b\">Re 11:1-11</a>) This vision again draws on a physical reality to illustrate a spiritual revivification. It also shows that the Greek <em>pneu&#x2B9;ma, </em>like the Hebrew <em>ru&#x2B9;ach, </em>may represent the life-giving force from God that animates the human soul or person. As <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/165/0\" data-bid=\"166-1\" class=\"b\">James 2:26</a> states: &#x201C;The body without spirit [<em>pneu&#x2B9;ma&#xB7;tos</em>] is dead.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Int.</em>Therefore, when God created man in Eden and blew into his nostrils &#x201C;the breath [form of <em>nesha&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;</em>] of life,&#x201D; it is evident that, in addition to filling the man&#x2019;s lungs with air, God caused the life-force, or spirit (<em>ru&#x2B9;ach</em>), to vitalize all the cells in Adam&#x2019;s body.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/166/0\" data-bid=\"167-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:7</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/167/0\" data-bid=\"168-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 104:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/167/1\" data-bid=\"168-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 17:25</a>.This life-force is passed on from parents to offspring through conception.

This being so, it is clear that the &#x201C;spirit,&#x201D; or life-force (<em>ru&#x2B9;ach</em>), as used in this sense is impersonal. As an illustration, one might compare it to another invisible force, electricity, which may be used to make various types of machines operate<wbr>&#x2014;causing stoves to produce heat, fans to produce wind, computers to solve problems, television sets to produce figures, voices and other sounds&#x2014;<wbr>yet which electric current never takes on any of the characteristics of the machines in which it functions or is active.Thus, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/171/0\" data-bid=\"172-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 146:3, 4</a> says that when man&#x2019;s &#x201C;spirit [form of <em>ru&#x2B9;ach</em>] goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day <em>his thoughts do perish.&#x201D; </em>The spirit, or life-force, that was active in man&#x2019;s body cells does not retain any of the characteristics of those cells, such as the brain cells and their part in the thinking process. If the spirit, or life-force (<em>ru&#x2B9;ach; pneu&#x2B9;ma</em>), were not impersonal, then it would mean that the children of certain women who were resurrected by the prophets Elijah and Elisha were actually in conscious existence somewhere in the period during which they were dead. So, too, with Lazarus, who was resurrected some four days after his death. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/172/0\" data-bid=\"173-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 17:17-23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/172/1\" data-bid=\"173-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 4:32-37;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/172/2\" data-bid=\"173-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 11:38-44</a>) If such had been the case, it is reasonable that they would have remembered such conscious existence during that period and upon being resurrected would have described it, told about it. There is nothing to indicate that any of them did so. Hence, the personality of the dead individual is not perpetuated in the life-force, or spirit, that stops functioning in the deceased person&#x2019;s body cells.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/173/0\" data-bid=\"174-1\" class=\"b\">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> states that at death the person&#x2019;s body returns to the dust, &#x201C;and the spirit itself returns to the true God who gave it.&#x201D; The person himself was never in heaven with God; what &#x201C;returns&#x201D; to God is therefore the vital force that enabled the person to live.In view of the impersonal nature of the life-force, or spirit, found in man (as also in the animal creation), it is evident that David&#x2019;s statement at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/174/0\" data-bid=\"175-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 31:5</a>, quoted by Jesus at the time of his death (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/175/0\" data-bid=\"176-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 23:46</a>), &#x201C;Into your hand I entrust my spirit,&#x201D; meant that God was being called upon to guard, or care for, that one&#x2019;s life-force.

This use of the Hebrew and Greek terms rendered &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; and basically related to breath or to air in motion is paralleled to a considerable degree by English expressions. Thus, we speak of a person as &#x2018;putting on airs,&#x2019; or of manifesting an &#x2018;air of calmness&#x2019; or of &#x2018;having a bad spirit.&#x2019; We speak of &#x2018;breaking a person&#x2019;s spirit,&#x2019; in the sense of discouraging and disheartening him.
