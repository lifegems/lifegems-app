It is traditionally suggested to be the red sandalwood (<em>Pterocarpus santalinus</em>) now found in India and Sri Lanka, although some favor the white sandalwood (<em>Santalum album</em>), perhaps because of Josephus&#x2019; statement that it is whitish in color. (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>VIII, 177 [vii,&#xA0;1]) The red sandalwood grows to heights of about 7.5 to 9&#xA0;m (25 to 30&#xA0;ft) and has a hard, fine-grained, reddish-brown wood that takes a high polish. It is suggested as suitable for musical instruments of the type mentioned in the Bible account. The wood has a sweet scent and is highly resistant to insects.The red sandalwood does not grow in Lebanon at the present time. However, the record is not definite whether the &#x201C;algum&#x201D; trees were native to Lebanon or not. At any rate, Hiram later saw fit to bring them from Ophir, and here again, the timbers may have been imports even in Ophir, as it was in position to act as a trading center dealing with India, Egypt, and other places in Africa.
