If Beth-marcaboth is the same as Madmannah, then it evidently lay on the main highway leading from Beer-sheba to Jerusalem and locations N, and the name Beth-marcaboth may be a secondary name for Madmannah. The name of the town listed after Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah (or Hazar-susim), means &#x201C;Courtyard (Settlement) of the Mare (or Horses).&#x201D; Some suggest that both places were depots and stations for horses and chariots, which traveled the ancient routes between Palestine and Egypt. Chariots were also used for war (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000697/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:19</a>), and Beth-marcaboth may have been a fortress city of the Canaanites from which their war chariots could proceed out onto the flatlands in the area of Beer-sheba.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000697/0\">MADMANNAH</a> No.&#xA0;2."}
