Each of the first four books, or collections, of the Psalms concludes with this expression, perhaps indicating that it was customary for the congregation of Israel to join in at the end of the song or psalm with an &#x201C;Amen.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 41:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 72:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 89:52;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> 106:48</a>.The Hebrew word <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;man&#x2B9; </em>is applied to Jehovah as &#x201C;the <em>faithful </em>God&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">De 7:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 49:7</a>) and describes his reminders and promises as &#x201C;trustworthy&#x201D; and &#x201C;faithful.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 19:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 89:28,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;37</a>) In the Christian Greek Scriptures the title &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; is applied to Christ Jesus as &#x201C;the faithful and true witness.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Re 3:14</a>) Jesus made singular use of the expression in his preaching and teaching, using it very often to preface a statement of fact, a promise, or a prophecy, thereby emphasizing the absolute truthfulness and reliability of what he said.

His course of faithfulness and obedience even to a sacrificial death confirms and makes possible the bringing to reality of all the promises and declarations of God&#x2019;s purpose.

It is true that not all the prayers recorded show such conclusion, such as David&#x2019;s closing prayer for Solomon (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 29:19</a>) or Solomon&#x2019;s dedication prayer at the inauguration of the temple (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 8:53-61</a>), although such expression may well have been made. (Note <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 29:20</a>.) Similarly, its use is not recorded in Jesus&#x2019; prayers (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:39,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/21/1\" data-bid=\"22-2\" class=\"b\"> 42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/21/2\" data-bid=\"22-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 17:1-26</a>) or in the prayer of the disciples at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 4:24-30</a>. However, the weight of the prior evidence presented strongly indicates the rightness of the use of &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; as a conclusion to prayer, and Paul&#x2019;s statement at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Corinthians 14:16</a> in particular shows that it was customary for those in Christian assembly to join in the Amen to a prayer. Additionally, the examples of those in heaven, recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 5:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> 7:10-12</a>; and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">19:1-4</a>, all give support to its use in subscribing to prayers or solemn statements and thereby, through the use of this one word, expressing the confidence, strong approval, and earnest hope that is in their hearts."}
