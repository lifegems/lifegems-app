{"title":"Mazzaroth Constellation","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200002943","html":"<span id=\"page355\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"355\" data-before-text=\"355\"></span><strong>MAZZAROTH CONSTELLATION</strong>(Maz&#x2B9;za&#xB7;roth).The Aramaic Targum equates Mazzaroth with the <em>maz&#xB7;za&#xB7;lohth&#x2B9; </em>of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002943/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Kings 23:5</a>, &#x201C;constellations of the zodiac,&#x201D; or &#x201C;twelve signs, or, constellations.&#x201D; (<em>NW; KJ </em>margin) Some believe that the word is derived from a root meaning &#x201C;engird&#x201D; and that Mazzaroth refers to the zodiacal circle. However, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002943/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job 38:32</a> a singular pronoun is used in Hebrew in the expression &#x201C;in its appointed time,&#x201D; whereas the reference in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002943/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Kings 23:5</a> is in the plural. Hence, Mazzaroth appears to refer to a particular constellation rather than to the entire zodiacal circle, but no positive identification is possible at present.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002943/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Job 38:32</a> Jehovah asks Job: &#x201C;Can you bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time? And as for the Ash constellation alongside <span id=\"page356\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"356\" data-before-text=\"356\"></span>its sons, can you conduct them?&#x201D; Thus, whatever the identification of these particular constellations may be, God puts the question to Job whether he can control the visible celestial bodies, bringing forth a certain group at its proper season or guiding another constellation in its prescribed heavenly course."}
