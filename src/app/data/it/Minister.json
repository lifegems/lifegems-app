As both the Revelation vision and Jesus himself showed (by illustration), in the time of Christ&#x2019;s presence on his glorious throne, there would be such persons who would also lovingly minister to the brothers of Jesus Christ, giving them aid, attention, and assistance.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Re 7:9-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 25:31-40</a>.<strong>Ministerial Servants in the Congregation. </strong>After listing requirements for those serving as &#x201C;overseers&#x201D; (<em>e&#xB7;pi&#x2B9;sko&#xB7;poi</em>) in the congregations, the apostle Paul lists such for those designated as &#x201C;ministerial servants&#x201D; (<em>di&#xB7;a&#x2B9;ko&#xB7;noi</em>). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 3:1-10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/41/1\" data-bid=\"42-2\" class=\"b\"> 12,&#xA0;13</a>) The Greek word <em>di&#xB7;a&#x2B9;ko&#xB7;nos </em>is in places translated simply &#x201C;minister&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 20:26</a>) and &#x2018;servant.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 22:13</a>) Since all Christians were &#x201C;ministers&#x201D; (servants) of God, it is evident that the term <em>di&#xB7;a&#x2B9;ko&#xB7;noi </em>here takes on a particular sense, one related to congregational order and structure. Thus, there were two bodies of men filling positions of congregational responsibility: the &#x201C;overseers,&#x201D; or &#x201C;older men,&#x201D; and the &#x201C;ministerial servants.&#x201D; There were generally a number of both overseers and ministerial assistants in each congregation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Php 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/44/1\" data-bid=\"45-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 20:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/44/2\" data-bid=\"45-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;28</a>.The list of requirements for the ministerial servants as compared with that for the overseers, as well as the designations for the two positions, indicates that the ministerial servants were not assigned the responsibility of teaching or shepherding (a shepherd being an overseer of sheep). Teaching ability was not a prerequisite for their assignment. The designation <em>di&#xB7;a&#x2B9;ko&#xB7;nos </em>of itself indicates that these men served as assistants to the body of overseers in the congregation, their basic responsibility being that of caring for matters of a nonpastoral nature so that the overseers might concentrate their time and attention on their teaching and shepherding activity.An example of the principle governing this arrangement may be found in the action of the apostles when problems arose as to the distribution (literally, the service, <em>di&#xB7;a&#xB7;ko&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;a</em>) of food supplies made daily to those Christians in need at Jerusalem. Stating that it would not be &#x2018;pleasing for them to leave the word of God&#x2019; to concern themselves with administration of material food problems, the apostles instructed the disciples to &#x201C;search out for yourselves seven certified men from among you, full of spirit and wisdom, that we may appoint them over this necessary business; but we shall devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry [<em>di&#xB7;a&#xB7;ko&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;ai</em>] of the word.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 6:1-6</a>) This was the principle; but it does not necessarily hold that the seven men selected were, in this case, not qualified as &#x201C;older men&#x201D; (<em>pre&#xB7;sby&#x2B9;te&#xB7;roi</em>), for this was not a normal or regular situation but a special problem that had arisen, one of a rather delicate nature due to the feeling that discrimination existed because of nationality. Since it affected the entire Christian congregation, it was a matter calling for &#x201C;spirit and wisdom,&#x201D; and thus the seven men selected may, in fact, have been in a spiritual sense &#x201C;older men.&#x201D; But they were now taking on temporarily an assignment of work such as that which &#x201C;ministerial servants&#x201D; might normally handle. It was business that was &#x201C;necessary&#x201D; but not of the same importance as &#x201C;the ministry of the word.&#x201D;The apostles showed their proper evaluation of matters in this action, and it may be expected that the bodies of overseers in the congregations that developed outside of Jerusalem would follow their example in assigning duties to the &#x201C;ministerial servants.&#x201D; There were doubtless many matters of a more material, routine, or mechanical nature that required attention, perhaps including the purchase of material for copying the Scriptures or even the copying itself.The qualifications to be met by the ministerial assistants provided standards that would protect the congregation from any legitimate accusation as to its selection of men for particular duties, thus maintaining a right standing with God and a clean reputation among outsiders. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 3:10</a>.) The qualifications governed morality, conduct, and spirituality and, where observed, would bring into service men who were sensible, honest, conscientious, and reliable. Those who ministered in a fine manner would acquire for themselves &#x201C;a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 3:13</a>.<strong>Earthly Rulers. </strong>God has permitted the governments of this world to operate until his due time to bring them to an end, after which Christ&#x2019;s Kingdom will rule the earth undisputedly. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Da 2:44;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/48/1\" data-bid=\"49-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 19:11-21</a>) During the time of their tolerated rule, they perform many services for the people, such as the building of roads, operation of schools, police and fire departments, and other services. They also have laws to punish thieves, murderers, and other lawbreakers. Therefore, as they perform these services and justly carry out these laws, they are &#x2018;ministers&#x2019; (<em>di&#xB7;a&#x2B9;ko&#xB7;noi</em>) of God. If anyone, even a Christian, violates such laws, the punishment he receives at the hands of the government is in an indirect way from God, for God is against all wickedness. Also, if the government protects the Christian from violators of the law, it <span id=\"page410\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"410\" data-before-text=\"410\"></span>is acting as a minister of God. It follows that if the ruler misuses his authority and acts against God, he is responsible and must answer to God for it. If such wicked ruler tries to get the Christian to act in violation of God&#x2019;s law, then he is not acting as God&#x2019;s minister and will receive punishment from God.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 13:1-4</a>.<strong>False Ministers. </strong>There are men who claim to be ministers of God but who are hypocrites, actually ministers of Satan fighting against God. The apostle Paul had to contend with such ones who were troubling the congregation in Corinth. Of them, he said: &#x201C;Such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness. But their end shall be according to their works.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003068/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 11:13-15</a>.The appearance of such false ministers was foretold many times in the Scriptures. Paul told the overseers of the congregation at Ephesus that after his going away, oppressive wolves would enter in among the congregation and would not treat the flock with tenderness; they would speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.
