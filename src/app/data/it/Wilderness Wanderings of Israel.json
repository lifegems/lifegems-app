It was a &#x201C;great and fear-inspiring wilderness, with poisonous serpents and scorpions and with thirsty ground that has no water.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 8:15</a>) Why were they made to undergo this ordeal?At Mount Sinai (the likely location of which is shown below), Jehovah assembled the Israelites after their departure from Egypt, gave them his laws through Moses, and organized them into a nation. After that they could have entered the Promised Land within a short time, but they did not. Why? Despite all that Jehovah had done for them, they failed to exercise faith and they rebelled against Moses, whom God had appointed to lead them. Choosing to believe a bad report about Canaan, the Israelites longed to be taken back to Egypt! (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 14:1-4</a>) This brought Jehovah&#x2019;s swift judgment: Forty years would pass before the nation would enter the Promised Land. By then, the faithless members of that generation would have died off.The wilderness experience of Israel is a powerful warning to Christians today to avoid the snare of lack of faith.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 3:7-12</a>.<span id=\"page541\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"541\" data-before-text=\"541\"></span><strong>[Chart/<wbr>Map on page&#xA0;541]</strong>(For fully formatted text, see publication)<strong>Route Followed by Israelites</strong><strong>Principal Trade Routes</strong><em>Great Sea</em> <em>Way to the Land of the Philistines</em><em>Jordan River</em>Plains of MoabMt.&#xA0;NeboAlmon-diblathaimDibon-gadAradIye-abarimZalmonahPunonMt.&#xA0;Hor<em>Salt Sea</em>Wilderness of ZinBene-jaakanKadesh <em>King&#x2019;s Road</em> <em>Way to Shur</em>Wilderness of ParanHor-haggidgadRissahJotbathahAbronahEzion-geber <em>El Haj Route</em>Rimmon-perezWilderness of EthamMarahElimWilderness of SinDophkahHazerothKibroth-hattaavahRephidimMt.&#xA0;Sinai<em>Red Sea</em><strong>[Chart]</strong><strong>PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS With Related Scriptures</strong>Hazeroth           <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 12:1-16</a>Kadesh             <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 12:16&#x2013;14:35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:1-21</a>Kibroth-hattaavah  <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:4-34</a>Marah              <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 15:23-26</a>Mount Hor          <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 20:22-29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 33:37-39</a>Mount Nebo         <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">De 34:1-4</a>Mount Sinai        <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 18:5&#x2013;40:38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Le 1:1&#x2013;27:34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> Nu 1:1&#x2013;10:32</a>Plains of Moab     <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 22:1&#x2013;36:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> De 1:1&#x2013;33:29</a>Rephidim           <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 17:1-16</a>Wilderness of Sin  <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001067/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 16:1-36</a><span id=\"page542\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"542\" data-before-text=\"542\"></span><strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;542]</strong>Oases were few and far between in this land that was described as having &#x201C;no water&#x201D;<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;542]</strong>It was a &#x201C;great and fear-inspiring wilderness&#x201D; through which Israel wandered for 40 years<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;542]</strong>The head of the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba.
