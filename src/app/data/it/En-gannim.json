Its site is possibly at modern Beit Jimal about 2.5&#xA0;km (1.5&#xA0;mi) S of Beth-shemesh, or a site nearby. Umm Jina, which lies about 1&#xA0;km (0.5&#xA0;mi) W of Beth-shemesh, has been suggested by some as the site, but it is less probable, because no fountain is found there.<strong>2. </strong>A city located in the tribe of Issachar&#x2019;s inheritance.

Today it is identified with Jenin, a town on the S edge of the valley plain of Megiddo, or Jezreel, lying about 18&#xA0;km (11&#xA0;mi) SE of Megiddo and 8&#xA0;km (5&#xA0;mi) NE of Dothan, on the main road from Jerusalem to Nazareth. Jenin is surrounded by orchards and gardens and has a spring, which characteristics would harmonize with the meaning of the name En-gannim.En-gannim, with its pasture ground, was allotted to the sons of Gershon as a Levite city.
