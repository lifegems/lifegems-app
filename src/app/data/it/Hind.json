The hind is a slender, graceful creature, timid, surefooted, and swift. When heavy with young, the hinds retire to the recesses of the forest to give birth and then continue in seclusion, tenderly caring for and protecting the fawns until such time as they can care for themselves.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002030/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 39:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002030/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 29:9</a>.The gentle, graceful hind figures in the vivid imagery of the Bible.
