Later, when the believers received the holy spirit as a result of the apostles Peter and John laying their hands upon them, Simon displayed a wrong motive, offering money for the authority needed so that those upon whom he laid his hands would receive holy spirit. Peter strongly rebuked him, telling Simon that his heart was not straight in God&#x2019;s sight and urging him to repent and pray for forgiveness. In response, Simon asked these apostles to make supplication to Jehovah in his behalf.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004131/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 8:9-24</a>.<strong>9. </strong>A tanner of Joppa in whose house by the sea the apostle Peter was entertained for quite a few days in 36&#xA0;C.E.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004131/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 9:43;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004131/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004131/12/2\" data-bid=\"13-3\" class=\"b\"> 17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004131/12/3\" data-bid=\"13-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;32</a>."}
