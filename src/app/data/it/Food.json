To you let it serve as food.&#x201D; He further stated that to all the animal creation he had given &#x201C;all green vegetation for food.&#x201D; To Adam he also said: &#x201C;From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction,&#x201D; adding a prohibition on one tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:29, 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:16,&#xA0;17</a>.From that time until the Flood, the Bible gives no indication that man included the flesh of animals in his diet. True, a distinction was made between clean and unclean animals, but this evidently was with regard to animals used for sacrificial purposes.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 7:2</a>.When Noah was commanded to take the animals into the ark, Jehovah told him: &#x201C;As for you, take for yourself every sort of food that is eaten; and you must gather it to yourself, and it must serve as food for you and for them,&#x201D; again seemingly having reference to food from the vegetable kingdom for the humans and the animals taken into the ark. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 6:21</a>) After the Flood, Jehovah allowed man to add flesh to his diet, saying: &#x201C;Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you.

Only flesh with its soul<wbr>&#x2014;its blood&#x2014;<wbr>you must not eat.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 9:3,&#xA0;4</a>.<strong>Cereals. </strong>Cereals constituted the basic food of the people of Bible lands, as is evident from the fact that in both Hebrew and Greek the expression &#x201C;eat a meal&#x201D; literally means &#x201C;eat bread.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 43:31,&#xA0;32</a>) Barley and wheat were the chief cereals; other cereals mentioned are millet and spelt, a form of wheat.

Grain was often eaten roasted, either by taking a bunch of the grain ears together and holding them over a fire or by roasting them in a pan. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ru 2:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 17:28</a>) It was made into bread, usually with the grain ground coarsely.

Ferment or leaven was often used, while some bread was baked unfermented.

Cakes were sometimes prepared in a pan, on a griddle, or in a deep-fat kettle. The fat used was oil, probably olive oil.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Le 2:4, 5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 9:31</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/0\">BAKE, BAKER</a>.<strong>Vegetables. </strong>Beans and lentils were included in the diet, being made into a stew such as the lentil stew that Jacob made and for which Esau sold his birthright.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 4:9</a>) Cucumbers of a variety that is more tasty than the Western variety constituted a refreshing food. When water was scarce or bad, these could be eaten to provide a substitute for water. Cucumbers were eaten raw, with or without salt, and were sometimes stuffed and cooked. The Israelites looked back with longing for the cucumbers, the watermelons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic that they ate in Egypt. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:4,&#xA0;5</a>) These foods were also produced in Palestine.Job mentions &#x201C;marshmallow,&#x201D; the juice of which he describes as tasteless. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Job 6:6</a>) He also speaks of those in destitute circumstances as eating the salt herb and the roots of broom trees.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Job 30:4</a>.The Mishnah (<em>Pesahim </em>2:6) mentions endive and chicory as the bitter greens used at the Passover.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 12:8</a>.<span id=\"page844\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"844\" data-before-text=\"844\"></span><strong>Fruits and Nuts. </strong>The olive was an outstanding article of food in Palestine. The tree may take ten years or longer to begin producing good harvests, but its great longevity makes it very fruitful. The fruits of the olive tree may have been eaten as today, after being soaked in brine. Olives also provided oil for cooking such items as stews and oiled cakes. The Bible mentions &#x201C;well-oiled dishes.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 25:6</a>.Figs were another important item of diet.

When the Israelites spied out the land of Canaan they brought back a great cluster of grapes, carried on a bar between two men. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 13:23</a>) Grapes were eaten in their natural state and also dried (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 6:3</a>) and pressed into cakes.

The hungry prodigal son in Jesus&#x2019; illustration expressed the desire to feed on them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 15:16</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001541/2\">CAROB POD</a>.<strong>Spices and Honey. </strong>Spices prominently used for seasoning were mint, dill, cumin, rue, and mustard leaves.

In a warm climate the juice would not long be free from ferment. Several months intervened between grape harvest and Passover time. At Passover it became the custom for family groups to drink several cups of wine, which, by that time, would be fermented. Hence, in celebrating the Passover of 33&#xA0;C.E., Jesus drank real red wine, some of which he offered to his disciples in introducing the Lord&#x2019;s Evening Meal.
