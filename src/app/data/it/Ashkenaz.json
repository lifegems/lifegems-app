Thus, even today Jews from Germanic countries are referred to as Ashkenazim in contrast to the Sephardim, Jews from Spain and Portugal.<strong>2. </strong><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000423/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 51:27</a> mentions a kingdom of Ashkenaz as allying itself with the kingdoms of Ararat and Minni against Babylon at the time of her downfall (539&#xA0;B.C.E.). Since Ararat is believed to have been located in the region of Lake Van, and Minni (referred to as &#x201C;Mannai&#x201D; in Assyrian inscriptions) is considered to have been SE of Lake Van, it is likely that the kingdom of Ashkenaz lay near these regions, probably somewhat to the N in the area between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.The name Ashkenaz is considered by archaeologists as equivalent to the Assyrian <em>Ashguzai, </em>which term was evidently applied to the ancient Scythians of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea area. Cuneiform tablets record an alliance between this tribe and the Mannai (Minni) in a revolt against Assyria in the seventh century B.C.E."}
