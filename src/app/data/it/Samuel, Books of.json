Indicative of this is a note in the Masora showing that words in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">First Samuel, chapter&#xA0;28</a> (one of the concluding chapters of First Samuel), were in the middle of the book.<strong>Writers and Time Covered. </strong>Ancient Jewish tradition credits Samuel with the writership of the first part of the book, and Nathan and Gad with the remaining portion. That these three prophets did write is confirmed at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 29:29</a>. The book itself reports: &#x201C;Samuel spoke to the people about the rightful due of the kingship and wrote it in a book and deposited it before Jehovah.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 10:25</a>) However, on the basis of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 27:6</a>, where there is reference to &#x201C;the kings of Judah,&#x201D; numerous scholars place the final compiling of the books of Samuel sometime after the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel came into existence. If the expression &#x201C;the kings of Judah&#x201D; denotes only Judean kings of the <em>two-tribe kingdom, </em>this would show that the writings of Samuel, Nathan, and Gad must have been put into final form by someone else. On the other hand, if &#x201C;the kings of Judah&#x201D; simply means kings from the <em>tribe </em>of Judah, these words could have been recorded by Nathan, since he lived under the rulership of two Judean kings, David and Solomon.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 1:32-34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 9:29</a>.The fact that Hannah and an unnamed &#x201C;man of God&#x201D; used the expressions &#x201C;king&#x201D; and &#x201C;anointed one&#x201D; years before a king actually ruled over Israel does not support the argument of some that these passages date from a period later than indicated in the book. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 2:10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;35</a>) The idea of a future king was by no means foreign to the Hebrews. God&#x2019;s promise concerning Sarah, the ancestress of the Israelites, was that &#x201C;kings of peoples&#x201D; would come from her. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 17:16</a>) Also, Jacob&#x2019;s deathbed prophecy (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:10</a>), the prophetic words of Balaam (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 24:17</a>), and the Mosaic Law (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">De 17:14-18</a>) pointed to the time when the Israelites would have a king.The historical narrative contained in the two books of Samuel commences with the time of High Priest Eli and concludes with events from David&#x2019;s reign. It therefore covers a period of approximately 140 years (c.&#xA0;1180-c.&#xA0;1040&#xA0;B.C.E.). As David&#x2019;s death is not mentioned in the record, the account (possibly with the exception of editorial additions) was probably completed about 1040&#xA0;B.C.E.<strong>Authenticity. </strong>The authenticity of the account contained in the books of Samuel is well established. Christ Jesus himself, when refuting an objection raised by the Pharisees, cited the incident recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 21:3-6</a> about David&#x2019;s receiving showbread from Ahimelech the <span id=\"page854\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"854\" data-before-text=\"854\"></span>priest.

It exposes the wrongs of the priestly house of Eli (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 2:12-17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 22-25</a>), the corruption of Samuel&#x2019;s sons (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 8:1-3</a>), and the sins and family difficulties of King David (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 11:2-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/21/1\" data-bid=\"22-2\" class=\"b\"> 13:1-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/21/2\" data-bid=\"22-3\" class=\"b\"> 15:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/21/3\" data-bid=\"22-4\" class=\"b\"> 24:10</a>).Another evidence of the authenticity of the account is the fulfillment of prophecies. These relate to Israel&#x2019;s request for a king (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">De 17:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 8:5</a>), Jehovah&#x2019;s rejection of Eli&#x2019;s house (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 2:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:12-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/23/2\" data-bid=\"24-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 2:27</a>), and the continuance of the kingship in David&#x2019;s line (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 7:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 33:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/24/2\" data-bid=\"25-3\" class=\"b\"> Eze 21:25-27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/24/3\" data-bid=\"25-4\" class=\"b\"> Mt 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/24/4\" data-bid=\"25-5\" class=\"b\"> Lu 1:32,&#xA0;33</a>).The record is in complete harmony with the rest of the Scriptures. This is especially noticeable when examining the psalms, many of which are illuminated by what is contained in the books of Samuel. King Saul&#x2019;s sending messengers to watch David&#x2019;s house in order to kill him provides the background for <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm&#xA0;59</a>.

Numerous scholars have, therefore, concluded that the omissions are later additions to the Hebrew text. Arguing against this view, C.&#xA0;F.&#xA0;Keil and F.&#xA0;Delitzsch comment: &#x201C;The notion, that the sections in question are interpolations that have crept into the text, cannot be sustained on the mere authority of the Septuagint version; since the arbitrary manner in which the translators of this version made omissions or additions at pleasure is obvious to any one.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Commentary on the Old Testament, </em>1973, Vol.&#xA0;II, 1&#xA0;Samuel, p.&#xA0;177, ftn.If it could be definitely established that actual discrepancies exist between the omitted sections and the rest of the book, the authenticity of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 17:12-31, </a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/56/1\" data-bid=\"57-2\" class=\"b\">55&#x2013;18:6a</a> would reasonably be in question. A comparison of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 16:18-23</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 17:55-58</a> reveals what appears to be a contradiction, for in the latter passage Saul is depicted as asking about the identity of his own court musician and armor-bearer, David. However, it should be noted that David&#x2019;s earlier being described as &#x201C;a valiant, mighty man and a man of war&#x201D; could have been based on his courageous acts in single-handedly killing a lion and a bear to rescue his father&#x2019;s sheep. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 16:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/59/1\" data-bid=\"60-2\" class=\"b\"> 17:34-36</a>) Also, the Scriptures do not state that David actually served in battle as Saul&#x2019;s armor-bearer before he killed Goliath. Saul&#x2019;s request to Jesse was: &#x201C;Let David, please, keep attending upon me, for he has found favor in my eyes.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 16:22</a>) This request does not preclude the possibility that Saul later permitted David to return to Bethlehem so that, when war broke out with the Philistines, David was then shepherding his father&#x2019;s flock.Regarding Saul&#x2019;s question, &#x201C;Whose son is the boy, Abner?&#x201D; the aforementioned commentary observes (p.&#xA0;178, ftn.): &#x201C;Even if Abner had not troubled himself about the lineage of Saul&#x2019;s harpist, Saul himself could not well have forgotten that David was a son of the Bethlehemite Jesse. But there was much more implied in Saul&#x2019;s question. It was not the name of David&#x2019;s father alone that he wanted to discover, but what kind of man the father of a youth who possessed the courage to accomplish so marvellous a heroic deed really was; and the question was put not merely in order that he might grant him an exemption of his house from taxes as the reward promised for the conquest of Goliath (ver.&#xA0;25), but also in all probability that he might attach such a man to his court, since he inferred from the courage and bravery of the son the existence of similar qualities in the father. It is true that David merely replied, &#x2018;The son of thy servant Jesse of Bethlehem;&#x2019; but it is very evident from the expression in ch. xviii. 1, &#x2018;when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul,&#x2019; that Saul conversed with him still further about his family affairs, since the very words imply a lengthened conversation.&#x201D; (For other instances where &#x201C;who&#x201D; involves more than mere knowledge of a person&#x2019;s name, see <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 5:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/61/1\" data-bid=\"62-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 25:10</a>.)So there is sound reason for viewing <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 17:12-31, </a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003825/62/1\" data-bid=\"63-2\" class=\"b\">55&#x2013;18:6a</a> as part of the original text.<span id=\"page852\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"852\" data-before-text=\"852\"></span><strong>[Box on page&#xA0;852]</strong><strong>HIGHLIGHTS OF </strong><strong>FIRST SAMUEL</strong>  Record of the beginning of kingship in Israel, emphasizing obedience to Jehovah  Written by Samuel, Nathan, and Gad;
