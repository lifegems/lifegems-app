Adoni-zedek joined with other petty kingdoms W of the Jordan in a consolidated effort to halt Joshua&#x2019;s conquering forces. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000113/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 9:1-3</a>) However, the Hivite inhabitants of Gibeon made peace with Joshua. In a retaliatory measure designed to stop further desertion to the enemy, Adoni-zedek united his army with those of four additional kings of the Amorites, and he laid siege against Gibeon and warred against it. Joshua&#x2019;s spectacular rescue of the Gibeonites and the shattering defeat of these combined forces caused the five kings to flee to Makkedah, where they were trapped in a cave. Joshua himself slew Adoni-zedek and the other four kings before his troops, and hung them upon stakes. Their corpses were finally thrown back into the cave, which came to be their tomb.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000113/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 10:1-27</a>."}
