Cypress is included along with other trees as forming part of the &#x201C;glory of Lebanon,&#x201D; and this is indicative of the place where it grew and also suggests a tree of desirable qualities or impressive appearance. The &#x201C;box tree&#x201D; referred to in the <em>King James Version </em>is not a likely translation since, according to some scholars, the box tree does not grow in Palestine, and in Syria it is only a small shrub. (<em>Unger&#x2019;s Bible Dictionary, </em>1965, p.&#xA0;1134; <em>The Interpreter&#x2019;s Dictionary of the Bible, </em>edited by G.&#xA0;Buttrick, 1962, Vol.&#xA0;2, p.&#xA0;292) The cypress is considered by many to be the tree probably referred to by this Hebrew word at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001099/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 41:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001099/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 60:13</a>.<wbr>&#x2014;See Moffatt&#x2019;s translation; <em>A Dictionary of </em><span id=\"page564\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"564\" data-before-text=\"564\"></span><em>Life in Bible Times, </em>by W.&#xA0;Corswant, Suffolk, 1960, p.&#xA0;55; <em>The Interpreter&#x2019;s Dictionary of the Bible, </em>Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;459; Vol.&#xA0;2, p.&#xA0;292; <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>by L.&#xA0;Koehler and W.&#xA0;Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;1017.The cypress (<em>Cupressus sempervirens</em>) has dark-green foliage and branches that extend upward somewhat like those of the Lombardy poplar. It has an average height of 9 to 15&#xA0;m (30 to 50&#xA0;ft) but at times may grow as high as 24&#xA0;m (80&#xA0;ft). It is commonly cultivated throughout Palestine; some specimens have been found growing wild in Gilead, Edom, and on the slopes of Mount Lebanon. The wood has a rich reddish hue, is fragrant, and is of great durability. It was possibly employed by the Phoenicians, Cretans, and Greeks in shipbuilding (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001099/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:6</a>), and it is suggested by some that the &#x201C;resinous tree&#x201D; from which Noah obtained wood for the ark was the cypress tree.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001099/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 6:14</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001099/0\">RESINOUS TREE</a>.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001099/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 41:19</a> Jehovah promises to cause trees growing normally in fertile lands to thrive in desert areas as well, and in a prophecy concerning Zion&#x2019;s future exaltation and prosperity, it is foretold that the cypress, along with the ash and the juniper, will be used to beautify the place of God&#x2019;s sanctuary.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001099/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 60:13</a>.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001099/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 27:6</a>, the expression &#x201C;in cypress wood&#x201D; is in agreement with the Targums. However, the Hebrew is <em>bath-&#x2BC;ashu&#xB7;rim&#x2B9; </em>and means &#x201C;the daughter of the Ashurites.&#x201D; A number of scholars have concluded that these two Hebrew words should read as one word, <em>bith&#xB7;&#x2BC;ash&#xB7;shu&#xB7;rim&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;in cypress wood.&#x201D;"}
