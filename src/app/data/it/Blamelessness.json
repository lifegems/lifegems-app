(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Ca 5:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 6:9</a>) By reason of his peaceful, quiet life in tents as contrasted with his brother&#x2019;s wild, adventurous life as a hunter, Jacob was said to be blameless. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 25:27</a>) Another Hebrew word at times rendered &#x201C;blameless&#x201D; is <em>ta&#xB7;mim&#x2B9;, </em>having the sense of being &#x201C;faultless; sound; perfect.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 2:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;20</a>) The Hebrew words <em>tam </em>and <em>ta&#xB7;mim&#x2B9; </em>come from the root verb <em>ta&#xB7;mam&#x2B9;, </em>which has the meaning &#x201C;be complete, completed; come to perfection; come to a finish.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 19:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 6:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 18:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> Jer 24:10</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 16:11</a>, where the phrase translated &#x201C;Are these all the boys?&#x201D; literally means &#x201C;Are the boys completed?&#x201D;) In the Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>the Hebrew word <em>tam </em>is sometimes translated <em>a&#x2B9;mem&#xB7;ptos. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 2:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/5/3\" data-bid=\"6-4\" class=\"b\"> 9:20</a>) Forms of this word also appear in the Christian Greek Scriptures and may be defined as &#x201C;blameless; faultless.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 1:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Php 3:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 8:7</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/0\">PERFECTION</a>.When used in describing humans, the term &#x201C;blameless&#x201D; must always be viewed as relative, not absolute. Suffering Job drew wrong conclusions about Jehovah, including how the Almighty regarded blameless ones. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Job 9:20-22</a>) Zechariah, the father of John the Baptizer, manifested lack of faith in Jehovah&#x2019;s declaration through the angel Gabriel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 1:18-20</a>) Still, Job and Zechariah were said to be blameless, for they measured up to what Jehovah expected of humans who, though faithful, were marred by imperfection.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 1:6</a>.From the standpoint of his Jewish contemporaries, Paul was blameless before he became a disciple of Jesus Christ. He did what the Law commanded, fulfilling the obligations placed upon him and refraining from what was forbidden. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Php 3:6</a>) But Paul did not then enjoy a blameless standing before Jehovah. He was guilty of grave sin as a persecutor of Christ&#x2019;s brothers and was a blasphemer and an insolent man.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 1:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;15</a>.The Most High takes pleasure in those whose conduct is a reflection of their spiritual soundness, their purity, their blamelessness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 11:20</a>) So it is vital that Christians live in a manner that is blameless, free from justifiable censure.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Php 2:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000768/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Th 5:23</a>."}
