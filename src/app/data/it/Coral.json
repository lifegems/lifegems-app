Living in colonies, these tiny warm-water creatures take the calcium salts from the sea and build out of them beautifully branched, shrublike structures that are as hard as stone. In time the formations of some types of coral may amount to great coral reefs and the foundations of coral islands. There are different colors of coral, varieties of white, black, and red, the latter being the most costly and most desired in ancient times. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001034/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">La 4:7</a>.)
