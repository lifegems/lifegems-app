The Hebrew word <em>ga&#xB7;zam&#x2B9; </em>is thought to be derived from a root meaning &#x201C;cut.&#x201D; In numbers, caterpillars, like locusts, literally cut or shear away the leaves of vegetation piece by piece, leaf by leaf, until the plant is almost denuded of its greenery.

Also, Koehler and Baumgartner favor translating <em>ga&#xB7;zam&#x2B9; </em>as caterpillar. (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;178) It is thus rendered, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000905/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Joel 1:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000905/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:25</a>, <span id=\"page423\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"423\" data-before-text=\"423\"></span>in the translation by Isaac Leeser and in the <em>New World Translation; </em>&#x201C;palmerworm&#x201D; in the <em>King James Version; </em>&#x201C;shearer&#x201D; in <em>An American Translation.</em>Caterpillars are almost exclusively vegetarian. Their appetites are voracious, some caterpillars consuming twice their own weight of greenery in a day. Hence, in large numbers they cause no little damage to vegetation."}
