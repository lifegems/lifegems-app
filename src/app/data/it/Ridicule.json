There are a number of Hebrew and Greek words that express varying degrees of ridicule, the choice of word depending on circumstances. We therefore read in the Bible of persons that mock, deride, sneer, scoff, jeer, laugh at, or make fun of others.Ridiculers are, in general, detestable to others. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 24:9</a>) If such do not accept reproof, they will experience disaster.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 21:9</a>) Paul gives the prophetic application, saying: &#x201C;Now we, brothers, are children belonging to the promise the same as Isaac was.

But he recognized that the reproaches were actually against Jehovah, whom he represented, and this was all the more painful to him, for he &#x2018;always did the things pleasing to his Father&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 8:29</a>), and he was more concerned with the sanctification of his Father&#x2019;s name than with anything else. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:9</a>) Accordingly, &#x201C;when he was <span id=\"page808\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"808\" data-before-text=\"808\"></span>being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.&#x201D; The apostle Peter expresses this point when writing to Christians, particularly to slaves, exhorting them not to let such treatment incite them to retaliate; for Christ is their example, &#x201C;a model,&#x201D; Peter says, &#x201C;for [them] to follow his steps closely.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 2:18-23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 12:17-21</a>.At one point in his career, Jeremiah the prophet of God said, &#x201C;I became an object of laughter all day long; everyone is holding me in derision.&#x201D; Momentarily he weakened and considered stopping his prophetic work because of the unceasing reproach and jeering. But he recognized that it was &#x201C;for the word of Jehovah&#x201D; that the derision came, and God&#x2019;s word in his heart proved to be like a burning fire that he could not endure to hold in. For his faithfulness Jehovah was with him &#x201C;like a terrible mighty one,&#x201D; and Jeremiah was strengthened to keep on loyally.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 20:7-11</a>.Job was a man righteously maintaining his integrity through great ridicule.

In this he was like a person who gives himself up to derision and ridicule and delights in it, taking it in as though he were drinking water with enjoyment. God later explained to Job that these ridiculers were actually (in the final analysis) speaking untruth against <em>God. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Job 42:7</a>) Similarly, Jehovah told the prophet Samuel when Israel demanded a king: &#x201C;It is not you whom they have rejected, but it is I whom they have rejected from being king over them.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 8:7</a>) And Jesus said to his disciples: &#x201C;You will be objects of hatred by all the nations [not on your own account, but] on account of <em>my name.&#x201D; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:9</a>) Keeping these things in mind will enable the Christian to endure ridicule in the right spirit and will qualify him to receive a reward for his endurance.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 6:22,&#xA0;23</a>.<strong>Justifiable Ridicule. </strong>Ridicule may be deserved and well justified. A person who does not exercise foresight or who neglects good counsel may take a foolish course that makes him the object of ridicule. Jesus gave an example of such a man, who started to build a tower without first counting the cost. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 14:28-30</a>) Jehovah set Israel &#x201C;as a reproach to [her] neighbors, a derision and jeering to those all around&#x201D; her, justly so, because of her own waywardness and disobedience to God, even to the point of bringing reproach upon God&#x2019;s name among the nations.
