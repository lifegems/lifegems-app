Shortly before Goliath again came up from the battle lines of the Philistines to taunt Israel, David, having been sent by his father, arrived on the scene with provisions of food for his three brothers. Angered greatly by David&#x2019;s making inquiry among the Israelite warriors about the reward to be received by the one striking down Goliath, Eliab lashed out against David, suggesting that he was negligent in caring for his shepherding duties and accusing him of being presumptuous and having a bad heart.
