It is kindness that lovingly attaches itself to an object until its purpose in connection with that object is realized. Such is the sort of kindness that God expresses toward his servants and that they express toward him. It therefore comes into the field of loyalty, a righteous, devoted, holy loyalty, and is variously rendered &#x201C;loving-kindness&#x201D; and &#x201C;loyal love.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002784/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 20:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002784/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:23</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002784/0\">KINDNESS</a>.In the Greek Scriptures the noun <em>ho&#xB7;si&#xB7;o&#x2B9;tes </em>and the adjective <em>ho&#x2B9;si&#xB7;os </em>carry the thought of holiness, righteousness, reverence; being devout, pious; the careful observance of all duties toward God. It involves a right relationship with God.There appear to be no English words that exactly express the full meaning of the Hebrew and Greek words, but &#x201C;loyalty,&#x201D; including, as it does, the thought of devotion and faithfulness, when used in connection with God and his service, serves to give an approximation. The best way to determine the full meaning of the Bible terms in question is to examine their usage in the Bible.<strong>Jehovah&#x2019;s Loyalty. </strong>Jehovah God the Most Holy One, who is devoted to righteousness and who exercises unbreakable loving-kindness toward those who serve him, deals in righteousness and trueness even with his enemies and is eminently dependable. It is said of him: &#x201C;Great and wonderful are your works, Jehovah God, the Almighty. Righteous and true are your ways, King of eternity. Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, because you alone are loyal?&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002784/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Re 15:3,&#xA0;4</a>) Because Jehovah&#x2019;s loyalty to righteousness and justice, as well as his love for his people, prompts him to take needed judicial action, an angel was moved to say: &#x201C;You, the One who is and who was, the loyal One, are righteous, because you have rendered these decisions.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002784/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Re 16:5</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002784/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 145:17</a>.Jehovah is loyal to his covenants.
