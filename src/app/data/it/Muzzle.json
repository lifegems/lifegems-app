In preparation, the sheaves were untied and distributed over the hard-packed surface of the threshing floor until a thick layer was formed. Then one or more animals trod the grain with their hooves or it was threshed by means of a threshing sledge or other implement they drew over it. The Mosaic Law commanded: &#x201C;You must not muzzle a bull while it is threshing.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003141/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 25:4</a>) Thus it was not tortured with a desire to eat some of the grain that it was expending its strength to thresh.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003141/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 12:10</a>.The principle involved at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003141/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 25:4</a> can also be applied to human laborers. Paul told Timothy: &#x201C;Let the older men who preside in a fine way be reckoned worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching.&#x201D; Then, confirming his counsel, the apostle quoted the law about not muzzling a bull when it is <span id=\"page455\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"455\" data-before-text=\"455\"></span>threshing grain.
