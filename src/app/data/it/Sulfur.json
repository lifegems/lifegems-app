Its melting point is unusually low, 113&#xB0; C. (235&#xB0; F.). It readily burns with a pale blue flame, at the same time forming sulfur dioxide, which has a pungent odor.The first historical reference to sulfur tells how destruction rained down on the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah in the form of fire and sulfur.
