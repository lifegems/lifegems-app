(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004146/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 3:9</a>) The name Sirion appears in the Ugaritic texts found at Ras Shamra on the coast of northern Syria, thus corroborating the Bible&#x2019;s exactness. Like Senir, Sirion perhaps also designates a particular <span id=\"page975\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"975\" data-before-text=\"975\"></span>part of Mount Hermon. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004146/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 5:23</a>.) At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004146/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 29:6</a> Sirion and Lebanon are mentioned together. For this reason it has been suggested that Sirion perhaps refers to the Anti-Lebanon Range.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004146/0\">HERMON</a>."}
