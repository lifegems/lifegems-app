The common Greek word for demon (<em>dai&#x2B9;mon</em>) occurs only once in the Christian Greek Scriptures, in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 8:31</a>; elsewhere the word <em>dai&#xB7;mo&#x2B9;ni&#xB7;on </em>appears. <em>Pneu&#x2B9;ma, </em>the Greek word for &#x201C;spirit,&#x201D; at times is applied to wicked spirits, or demons. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 8:16</a>) It also occurs qualified by terms such as &#x201C;wicked,&#x201D; &#x201C;unclean,&#x201D; &#x201C;speechless,&#x201D; and &#x201C;deaf.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 7:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 10:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Mr 9:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 25</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/0\">SPIRIT</a> (Spirit Persons).The demons as such were not created by God. The first to make himself one was Satan the Devil (see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/1\">SATAN</a>), who became the ruler of other angelic sons of God who also made themselves demons.

In this regard the <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, </em>edited by G.&#xA0;Kittel (Vol.&#xA0;II, p.&#xA0;8) remarks: &#x201C;The meaning of the adj[ective <em>dai&#xB7;mo&#x2B9;ni&#xB7;os</em>] brings out most clearly the distinctive features of the G[ree]k conception of demons, for it denotes that which lies outwith human capacity and is thus to be attributed to the intervention of higher powers, whether for good or evil. [<em>To dai&#xB7;mo&#x2B9;ni&#xB7;on</em>] in pre-Christian writers can be used in the sense of the &#x2018;divine.&#x2019;&#x201D; (Translated and edited by G.&#xA0;Bromiley, 1971) When speaking controversially with Paul, some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers concluded: &#x201C;He seems to be a publisher of foreign deities [Gr., <em>dai&#xB7;mo&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;on</em>].&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 17:18</a>.When speaking to the Athenians, Paul used a compound of the Greek word <em>dai&#x2B9;mon, </em>saying: &#x201C;You seem to be more given to the fear of the deities [Gr., <em>dei&#xB7;si&#xB7;dai&#xB7;mo&#xB7;ne&#xB7;ste&#x2B9;rous; </em>Latin <em>Vulgate, </em>&#x2018;more superstitious&#x2019;] than others are.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 17:22</a>) Commenting on this compound word, F.&#xA0;F.&#xA0;Bruce remarks: &#x201C;The context must decide whether this word is used in its better or worse sense. It was, in fact, as vague as &#x2018;religious&#x2019; in Eng[lish], and here we may best translate &#x2018;very religious&#x2019;. But AV &#x2018;superstitious&#x2019; is not entirely wrong; to Paul their religion was mostly superstition, as it also was, though on other grounds, to the Epicureans.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Acts of the Apostles, </em>1970, p.&#xA0;335.When speaking to King Herod Agrippa&#xA0;II, Festus said that the Jews had certain disputes with Paul concerning their &#x201C;worship of the deity [Gr., <em>dei&#xB7;si&#xB7;dai&#xB7;mo&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;as; </em>Latin <em>Vulgate, </em>&#x2018;superstition&#x2019;].&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 25:19</a>) It was noted by F.&#xA0;F.&#xA0;Bruce that this Greek word &#x201C;might be less politely rendered &#x2018;superstition&#x2019; (as in AV). The corresponding adjective appears with the same ambiguity in [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Acts] 17:22</a>.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Commentary on the Book of the Acts, </em>1971, p.&#xA0;483.See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001153/4\">GOAT-SHAPED DEMON</a>."}
