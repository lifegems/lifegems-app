(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:37-41</a>) Within a short time, the disciples &#x2018;filled Jerusalem with their teaching.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 5:27, 28,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 40-42</a>) With what result? &#x201C;The number of the disciples kept multiplying in Jerusalem very much.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 6:7</a>.From Jerusalem, the witnessing work spread out. As a result of opposition to their witnessing in Jerusalem, the disciples were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Again, the result was increase.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 8:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 14-17</a>.In 36&#xA0;C.E. the apostle Peter brought the good news to Caesarea, where Cornelius and his household, the first uncircumcised Gentile converts, were baptized. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ac&#xA0;10</a>) Following that, systematic witnessing among non-Jews apparently began in Syrian Antioch. As a result, &#x201C;a great number that became believers turned to the Lord.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003644/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 11:20,&#xA0;21</a>) Since then, the witnessing work has expanded to other nations and has literally reached &#x201C;to the most distant part of the earth.&#x201D;<strong>[Map on page&#xA0;744]</strong>(For fully formatted text, see publication)<strong>Areas of Concentrated Activity</strong>RomeMACEDONIAGREECE<em>Black Sea</em>ASIABITHYNIAPONTUSGALATIACAPPADOCIAPAMPHYLIASYRIAJerusalemCYPRUSCRETEBabylon<em>Persian Gulf</em><strong>Areas Touched by the Good News in the First Century</strong>SPAINITALYMALTA<em>Mediterranean Sea</em>ILLYRICUMMESOPOTAMIAMEDIAPARTHIA<em>Caspian Sea</em>ELAMARABIACyreneLIBYAEGYPTETHIOPIA<em>Red Sea</em><span id=\"page745\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"745\" data-before-text=\"745\"></span><strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;745]</strong>Model of the first-century temple showing Solomon&#x2019;s Colonnade to the east.
