Some believe that this term may be related to a Hebrew root verb meaning &#x201C;grow weak; fall sick,&#x201D; thereby suggesting a gloomy and melancholy tune. This would harmonize with the somewhat somber content of the two songs, particularly that of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002841/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm&#xA0;88</a>."}
