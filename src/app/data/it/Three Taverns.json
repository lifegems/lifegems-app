The place perhaps got its name from three inns where travelers could stop to rest and refresh themselves. The site of Three Taverns is 49&#xA0;km (30&#xA0;mi) SE of Rome. The Marketplace of Appius was about 15&#xA0;km (9.5&#xA0;mi) farther down the Appian Way. A few Roman ruins are all that remain today at the site. Having heard about Paul&#x2019;s coming, part of the delegation of the Christians from Rome waited at Three Taverns while the rest traveled as far as the Marketplace of Appius.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004388/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 28:13-15</a>."}
