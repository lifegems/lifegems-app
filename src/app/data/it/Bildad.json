(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000733/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 2:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000733/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ge 25:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000733/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 1:32</a>) Taking his second-place turn in the three rounds of debate, Bildad usually followed the general theme set by Eliphaz; his speeches were shorter and more biting, though not to the degree of Zophar&#x2019;s. Bildad was the first to accuse Job&#x2019;s children of wrongdoing and of therefore meriting the calamity that befell them. With misguided reasoning he used this illustration: As papyrus and reeds dry up and die without water, likewise &#x201C;all those forgetting God&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;a statement true in itself, but most erroneous in the intimation that it applied to God-fearing Job. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000733/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job&#xA0;8</a>) Like Eliphaz, Bildad falsely classified Job&#x2019;s afflictions as those coming upon the wicked: &#x201C;no posterity and no progeny&#x201D; for poor Job, Bildad implied. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000733/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Job&#xA0;18</a>) With his third speech, a short one in which Bildad argued that man is &#x201C;a maggot&#x201D; and &#x201C;a worm&#x201D; and hence unclean before God, the words of &#x201C;comfort&#x201D; from Job&#x2019;s three companions came to an end. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000733/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Job&#xA0;25</a>) Finally, Bildad, along with the other two, was divinely instructed to offer a burnt sacrifice and to have Job pray in their behalf.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000733/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Job 42:7-9</a>."}
