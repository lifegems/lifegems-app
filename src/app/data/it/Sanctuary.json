But as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, cast it clear out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003828/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Re 11:1,&#xA0;2</a>) The temple here referred to could not be the one at Jerusalem, for that structure had been destroyed nearly three decades earlier. Being earthly, the nations could only be &#x201C;given&#x201D; a courtyard that was likewise on earth. So it must represent a condition enjoyed by Jesus&#x2019; anointed followers while here on earth. Whereas it would be impossible for the nations to trample upon a location in the heavens, they could treat disgracefully those persons who had been begotten by God&#x2019;s spirit to be his sons and who were in line to receive a heavenly inheritance with Christ.
