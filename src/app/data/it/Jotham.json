Thereafter, when the landowners of Shechem made Abimelech their king, Jotham stationed himself atop Mount Gerizim and, by means of an illustration involving trees, pronounced a prophetic malediction upon the landowners of Shechem and upon Abimelech. Subsequently Jotham fled and took up residence at Beer.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002529/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 9:6-21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002529/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;57</a>.<strong>3. </strong>Son of Judean King Uzziah (Azariah) by Jerusha(h) the daughter of Zadok.

But apparently not until Uzziah&#x2019;s death did 25-year-old Jotham begin his 16-year rule (777-762&#xA0;B.C.E.).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002529/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 15:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002529/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002529/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002529/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 26:18-21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002529/4/4\" data-bid=\"5-5\" class=\"b\"> 23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002529/4/5\" data-bid=\"5-6\" class=\"b\"> 27:8</a>.Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah served as prophets in the time of Jotham.

He warred with the Ammonites and finally triumphed over them. As a result, for three years they paid a yearly tribute of 100 silver talents ($660,600) and 10,000 cor measures (2,200&#xA0;kl; 62,500&#xA0;bu) both of wheat and of barley.

The writer of the Kings account may have chosen not to introduce Jotham&#x2019;s successor Ahaz at this point because of yet having to supply details about Jotham&#x2019;s reign.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;119]</strong>Signet ring bearing the name Jotham"}
