Though hard, and having a density about three and a half times as great as seasoned cedarwood, it is highly elastic and is easily carved or tooled.

The intersecting layers of dentin, alternating in shade, add to its utility a beauty all its own. &#x201C;Ivory&#x201D; is designated in Hebrew by the words <em>shen </em>(literally, tooth) and <em>shen&#xB7;hab&#xB7;bim&#x2B9; </em>(rendered &#x201C;elephants&#x2019; teeth&#x201D; in the Greek <em>Septuagint</em>).
