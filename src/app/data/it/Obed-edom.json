For the duration of its stay there, Obed-edom and his household were blessed by Jehovah, and when David learned of this he took it as an indication that Jehovah favored bringing the sacred chest on to Jerusalem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 6:10-12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 13:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 15:25</a>.Obed-edom was a &#x201C;Gittite.&#x201D; Normally this term designated a Philistine of Gath, but it can also refer to someone from Gath-rimmon, a Levite city in Dan assigned to the Kohathites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 21:20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 23,&#xA0;24</a>) Entrusted as he was with the care of the Ark, he had to be a Levite and hence must have been a Gittite from Gath-rimmon rather than a Philistine Gittite from Gath.The name Obed-edom is found a number of times among Levite musicians and gatekeepers of the Davidic period. There are at least two such individuals referred to (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 15:21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 16:38</a>), but beyond this it is impossible to determine whether the several other texts refer to either of these, or to still other contemporary individuals. Thus, Obed-edom, the Gittite, may possibly be the same as either No.&#xA0;2 or No.&#xA0;3.<strong>2. </strong>A musician and gatekeeper in the procession that brought the Ark to Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 15:18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;21</a>) He was likely the musician who continued to serve before the tent of the Ark in Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 16:4, 5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 37, 38a</a>) Possibly the same as No.&#xA0;1.<strong>3. </strong>A gatekeeper in the same procession. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 15:24</a>) He may also have been &#x201C;the son of Jeduthun.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 16:38b</a>) Possibly the same as No.&#xA0;1 or No.&#xA0;4.<strong>4. </strong>A Korahite in the permanent division of gatekeepers who, together with 62 relatives, was assigned to guard the S side of the sanctuary grounds in Jerusalem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 26:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 4-8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\"> 15</a>; see No.&#xA0;3.<strong>5. </strong>Caretaker of the gold, silver, and other articles in the house of Jehovah during the reign of King Amaziah. When Jehoash of Israel invaded Jerusalem sometime between 858 and 844&#xA0;B.C.E., these goods, and possibly Obed-edom himself, were all taken off to Samaria.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003291/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 25:23,&#xA0;24</a>."}
