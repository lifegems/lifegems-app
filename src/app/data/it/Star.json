The closest star to Earth, one of the Alpha Centauri group, is over 40,000,000,000,000&#xA0;km (25,000,000,000,000&#xA0;mi) away. Yet this immensity seems relatively small <span id=\"page1032\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1032\" data-before-text=\"1032\"></span>in view of the estimate that there are 100,000,000,000 galaxies throughout universal space.

As to the &#x201C;star&#x201D; (Gr., <em>a&#xB7;ster&#x2B9;</em>) seen by them, many suggestions have been given as to its having been a comet, a meteor, a supernova, or, more popularly, a conjunction of planets. None of such bodies could logically have &#x2018;come to a stop above where the young child was,&#x2019; thereby identifying the one house in the village of Bethlehem where the child was found. It is also notable that only these pagan astrologers &#x201C;saw&#x201D; the star. Their condemned practice of astrology and the adverse results of their visit, placing in danger the life of the future Messiah, certainly allow for, and even make advisable, the consideration of their having been directed by a source <em>adverse </em>to God&#x2019;s purposes as relating to the promised Messiah. It is certainly reasonable to ask if the one who &#x201C;keeps transforming himself into an angel of light,&#x201D; whose operation is &#x201C;with every powerful work and lying signs and portents,&#x201D; who was able to make a serpent appear to speak, and who was referred to by Jesus as &#x201C;a manslayer when he began,&#x201D; could not also cause astrologers to &#x2018;see&#x2019; a starlike object that guided them first, not to Bethlehem, but to Jerusalem, where resided a mortal enemy of the promised Messiah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 11:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Th 2:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/20/3\" data-bid=\"21-4\" class=\"b\"> Ge 3:1-4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/20/4\" data-bid=\"21-5\" class=\"b\"> Joh 8:44</a>.<strong>Figurative Use. </strong>Stars are used in the Bible in a figurative sense and in metaphors or similes to represent persons, as in Joseph&#x2019;s dream in which his parents were represented by the sun and moon, and his 11 brothers by 11 stars.
