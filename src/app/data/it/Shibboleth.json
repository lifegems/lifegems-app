It means &#x201C;ear of grain&#x201D; or &#x201C;flowing stream.&#x201D; Escaping Ephraimites, during their conflict with Jephthah, gave themselves away to the Gileadite sentries at the fords of the Jordan by mispronouncing the initial &#x201C;sh&#x201D; sound of this password. They would say &#x201C;Sibboleth.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004030/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 12:4-6</a>) Thus, it is evident that some variation of pronunciation existed among the tribes, even as in later times the Galileans had a manner of speech distinct from the Judeans.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004030/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:73;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004030/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 22:59</a>."}
