The Red Sea, as the term is now used, measures some 2,250&#xA0;km (1,400&#xA0;mi) in length, has a maximum width of about 354&#xA0;km (220&#xA0;mi) and an average depth of approximately 610&#xA0;m (2,000&#xA0;ft). It is part of the great geologic fault known as the Rift Valley. Because of a fast rate of evaporation, the waters of this sea are quite salty. Strong winds, rapid changes in wind direction, and the presence of large reefs make it hazardous for boats to navigate the Red Sea. Along the eastern coast there are high mountain ranges, whereas rocky tablelands and low hills occupy the western coast.There is good reason for understanding that the original-language expressions rendered &#x201C;Red Sea&#x201D; apply to the Red Sea in general or to either one of its northern arms.

On the basis of the literal meaning of <em>yam-suph&#x2B9;, </em>certain scholars have argued that the Israelites crossed a mere swampy place, such as the Bitter Lakes region, and not the Red Sea (principally the western arm, the Gulf of Suez, where others believe the crossing likely occurred). However, it should be noted that the waters were sufficient to cover Pharaoh&#x2019;s military forces.

The historian Herodotus (fifth century B.C.E.) used the same Greek expression to refer, not to a swamp or an insignificant body of water, but to <em>&#x201C;the Indian Ocean, </em>in which the Red Sea&#x201D; is located.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>A Greek-English Lexicon, </em>by H.&#xA0;G.&#xA0;Liddell and R.&#xA0;Scott, revised by H.&#xA0;Jones, Oxford, 1968, p.&#xA0;693; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003669/1\">PIHAHIROTH</a>.In a pronouncement of doom for Edom, the outcry resulting from Edom&#x2019;s calamity is described as being heard at the Red Sea.
