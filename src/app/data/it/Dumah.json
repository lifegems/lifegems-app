By the marriage of his sister Mahalath, Dumah became the brother-in-law to his half cousin Esau. Dumah also became a chieftain and head of a clan, or nation, in fulfillment of Jehovah&#x2019;s promise to Abraham.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001229/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 17:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001229/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 25:14-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001229/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 28:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001229/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 1:30</a>.The Ishmaelite Dumah evidently gave his name to a region in N Arabia about midway between the Promised Land and S Babylonia. The name continues in that of the oasis Dumat al-Ghandal (now known as Al-Jawf). Assyrian King Sennacherib mentions an <em>Adummatu, </em>which was &#x201C;situated in the desert.&#x201D; Esar-haddon says that an <em>Adumu </em>was conquered by his father Sennacherib.<strong>2. </strong>A city listed among those assigned to the tribe of Judah after the conquest of the land by Joshua.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001229/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 32:3</a>) The Greek <em>Septuagint </em>at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001229/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 21:11</a> says &#x201C;Idumea&#x201D; (the land of the Edomites) rather than &#x201C;Dumah.&#x201D;"}
