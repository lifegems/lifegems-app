The Israelites had come out of Egypt, where animals were deified. To the east and southeast of them now lay Ammon, Moab, and Edom<wbr>&#x2014;distant relatives of the Israelites but idol worshipers. The polytheistic Philistines occupied the coastal plain to the west. North of Israel along the coast were the Phoenicians, whose religious practices included sodomy, bestiality, and child sacrifice. And the religion of the Syrians featured nude representations of goddesses whose gestures emphasized their sexuality. To continue to be acceptable to Jehovah, Israel had to keep separate from the nations around them.As a safeguard to Israel, Jehovah gave them the Mosaic Law, which constituted a &#x2018;wall of separation&#x2019; to keep them apart from the surrounding nations. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 2:14</a>) They were not to form alliances with such nations, to intermarry with them, or to imitate their religious practices.

They could abandon their idolatrous ways and become worshipers of Jehovah. &#x201C;God is not partial.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 10:34</a>) While he was keeping Israel separate, Jehovah was working out his purpose for the eventual blessing of people of all nations.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:18</a>.<strong>[Chart/<wbr>Map on page&#xA0;945]</strong>(For fully formatted text, see publication)<em>Great Sea</em>PHOENICIASYRIAPHILISTIA Jerusalem <em>Salt Sea</em>AMMONMOABEDOM<strong>[Chart]</strong><strong>SURROUNDING NATIONS With Related Scriptures</strong>Ammon      <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 10:6-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 11:5</a>Edom       <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 25:14,&#xA0;15</a>Moab       <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 22:4-7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 25:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 3:26, 27</a>Philistia  <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 10:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 1:2</a>Phoenicia  <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 11:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> 16:30, 31</a>Syria      <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 10:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001696/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 28:20-23</a><span id=\"page946\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"946\" data-before-text=\"946\"></span><strong>[Pictures on page&#xA0;946]</strong>The Moabites lived in rugged territory east of the Dead Sea.
