From the beginning, his writership was not challenged, except by a small group in the second century who objected on the ground that they considered the book&#x2019;s teachings unorthodox, but not because of any evidence concerning <span id=\"page92\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"92\" data-before-text=\"92\"></span>writership. Only since the advent of modern &#x201C;critical&#x201D; scholarship has John&#x2019;s writership been challenged anew.The internal evidence that the apostle John, the son of Zebedee, was indeed the writer consists of such an abundance of proofs from various viewpoints that it overwhelms any arguments to the contrary. Only a very limited number of points are mentioned here, but the alert reader, with these in mind, will find a great many more. A few are:(1)&#xA0;The writer of the book was evidently a Jew, as is indicated by his familiarity with Jewish opinions.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 6:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 7:40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 12:34</a>.(2)&#xA0;He was a native dweller in the land of Palestine, as is indicated by his thorough acquaintance with the country.

No one but an apostle could have been eyewitness to so many events associated with Jesus&#x2019; ministry; also his intimate knowledge of Jesus&#x2019; mind, feelings, and reasons for certain actions reveals that he was one of the party of 12 who accompanied Jesus throughout his ministry. For example, he tells us that Jesus asked Philip a question to test him, &#x201C;for he himself knew what he was about to do.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 6:5,&#xA0;6</a>) Jesus knew &#x201C;in himself that his disciples were murmuring.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">6:61</a>) He knew &#x201C;all the things coming upon him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">18:4</a>) He &#x201C;groaned in the spirit and became troubled.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">11:33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> compare 13:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/12/2\" data-bid=\"13-3\" class=\"b\"> 2:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/12/3\" data-bid=\"13-4\" class=\"b\"> 4:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/12/4\" data-bid=\"13-5\" class=\"b\"> 6:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/12/5\" data-bid=\"13-6\" class=\"b\"> 7:1</a>.)

There is no evidence whatsoever for such an early date for the writing of this Gospel. Peter is ruled out by having his name mentioned alongside &#x201C;the disciple whom Jesus used to love.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 21:20,&#xA0;21</a>.<strong>Authenticity. </strong>The Gospel of John was accepted as canonical by the early Christian congregation. It appears in nearly all the ancient catalogs, being there accepted without query as authentic. The epistles of Ignatius of Antioch (c.&#xA0;110&#xA0;C.E.) contain clear traces of his use of John&#x2019;s Gospel, as do also the writings of Justin Martyr a generation later. It is found in all the most important codices of the Christian Greek Scriptures&#x2014; the Sinaitic, Vatican, Alexandrine, Ephraemi, Bezae, Washington I, and Koridethi codices<wbr>&#x2014;as well as in all the early versions. A fragment of this Gospel containing part of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">John chapter&#xA0;18</a> is contained in the John Rylands Papyrus 457 (P&#x2060;<sup>52</sup>), of the first half of the second century. Also parts of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">chapters&#xA0;10</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">11</a> are found in the Chester Beatty Papyrus No.&#xA0;1 (P&#x2060;<sup>45</sup>), and a large part of the whole book is found in the Bodmer Papyrus No.&#xA0;2 (P&#x2060;<sup>66</sup>) of the early third century.<strong>When and Where Written. </strong>It is generally thought that John had been released from exile on the island of Patmos and was in or near Ephesus, about 100&#xA0;km (60&#xA0;mi) from Patmos, at the time he wrote his Gospel, about 98&#xA0;C.E. Roman Emperor Nerva (96-98&#xA0;C.E.) recalled many who had been exiled at the close of the reign of his predecessor Domitian. John may have been among these. In the Revelation that John received on Patmos, Ephesus was one of the congregations to which he was commanded to write.John had reached a very old age, being probably about 90 or 100 when he wrote his Gospel. He was undoubtedly familiar with the other three accounts of Jesus&#x2019; earthly life and ministry, also the Acts of Apostles and the letters written by Paul, Peter, James, and Jude. He had had opportunity to see Christian doctrine fully revealed and had seen the effects of its preaching to all nations. He also had seen the beginning of &#x201C;the man of lawlessness.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">2Th 2:3</a>) He had witnessed many of Jesus&#x2019; prophecies already fulfilled, notably the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of that Jewish system of things.<strong>Purpose of John&#x2019;s Gospel. </strong>John, inspired by holy spirit, was selective in the events he chose to chronicle, because, as he says: &#x201C;To be sure, Jesus performed many other signs also before the disciples, which are not written down in this scroll,&#x201D; and, &#x201C;There are, in fact, many other things also which Jesus did, which, if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose, the world itself could not contain the scrolls written.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 20:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:25</a>.With these things in mind, John states his purpose for writing the account he was led by inspiration to write, in which he repeated little that had been written before: &#x201C;But these have been written down that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that, because of believing, you may have life by means of his name.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 20:31</a>.John emphasized the fact that what he wrote was real and true and that it had actually taken place. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:24</a>) His Gospel is a valuable addition to the Bible canon as the actual eyewitness evidence from the last living apostle of Jesus Christ.<strong>Widely Published. </strong>The Good News According to John has been the most widely published of any part of the Bible. Thousands of copies of the <span id=\"page94\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"94\" data-before-text=\"94\"></span>Gospel of John have been separately printed and distributed, apart from its being included in copies of the complete Bible.<strong>Value. </strong>In harmony with the Revelation, in which Jesus Christ states that he is &#x201C;the beginning of the creation by God&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Re 3:14</a>), John points out that this One was with God &#x201C;in the beginning&#x201D; and that &#x201C;all things came into existence through him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:1-3</a>) Throughout the Gospel he stresses the intimacy of this only-begotten Son of God with his Father, and he quotes many of Jesus&#x2019; statements revealing that intimacy. Throughout the book we are kept aware of the Father-Son relationship, the subjection of the Son, and the worship of Jehovah as God by his Son. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 20:17</a>) This closeness qualified the Son to reveal the Father as no one else could and as God&#x2019;s servants of ages past never realized. And John highlights the affectionate love of the Father for the Son and for those who become God&#x2019;s sons by exercising faith in the Son.Jesus Christ is presented as God&#x2019;s channel of blessing to mankind and the only way of approach to God. He is revealed as the One through whom undeserved kindness and truth come (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:17</a>), also as &#x201C;the Lamb of God&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">1:29</a>), &#x201C;the only-begotten Son of God&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">3:18</a>), &#x201C;the bridegroom&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">3:29</a>), &#x201C;the true bread from heaven&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">6:32</a>), &#x201C;the bread of God&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">6:33</a>), &#x201C;the bread of life&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">6:35</a>), &#x201C;living bread&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">6:51</a>), &#x201C;the light of the world&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">8:12</a>), &#x201C;the Son of man&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">9:35</a>), &#x201C;the door&#x201D; of the sheepfold (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">10:9</a>), &#x201C;the fine shepherd&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">10:11</a>), &#x201C;the resurrection and the life&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">11:25</a>), &#x201C;the way and the truth and the life&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">14:6</a>), and &#x201C;the true vine&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">15:1</a>).Jesus Christ&#x2019;s position as King is stressed (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:49;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/43/1\" data-bid=\"44-2\" class=\"b\"> 12:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/43/2\" data-bid=\"44-3\" class=\"b\"> 18:33</a>), also his authority as Judge (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">5:27</a>) and the power of resurrection granted him by his Father.

Jesus made it clear that the holy spirit could not come in such capacity unless he went to the Father, who is greater than he is. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">16:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/47/1\" data-bid=\"48-2\" class=\"b\"> 14:28</a>) Then his disciples would do even greater works, for the reason that Christ would again be with his Father and would answer requests asked in his own name, all for the purpose of bringing glory to the Father.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002490/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">14:12-14</a>.John reveals Jesus Christ also as the sacrificial ransom for mankind.

They are not found in the Sinaitic Manuscript or the Vatican Manuscript No.&#xA0;1209, though they do appear in the fifth-century Codex Bezae and later Greek manuscripts. They are omitted, however, by most of the early versions. It is evident that they are not part of John&#x2019;s Gospel.
