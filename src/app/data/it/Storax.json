The storax grows as a tall shrub or small tree, seldom exceeding 6&#xA0;m (20&#xA0;ft) in height. It is plentiful in Syria, where Jacob made use of its staffs (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004240/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 30:37</a>), and throughout Palestine, often growing on dry hillsides and rocky places, where its shade would be appreciated. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004240/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 4:13</a>) Its oval-shaped leaves, growing on long flexible twigs, are green on top but woolly white underneath. The showy flowers with their white petals and delightful fragrance are very similar to orange blossoms."}
