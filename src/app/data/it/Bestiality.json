The Mosaic Law emphatically condemned this perverted practice, sentencing the guilty person and the beast to death. &#x201C;Where a man gives his seminal emission to a beast, he should be put to death without fail, and you should kill the beast. And where a woman approaches any beast to have a connection with it, you must kill the woman and the beast.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000664/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Le 20:15, 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000664/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000664/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Ex 22:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000664/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> De 27:21</a>.This prohibition, together with the rest of God&#x2019;s laws governing sex relations, lifted the Israelites to a much higher moral level than their neighbors. In Egypt, bestiality constituted a part of idolatrous animal worship; historians attest to the cohabitation of women with goats, for example. Similar practices were also prevalent among the Canaanites (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000664/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Le 18:23-30</a>), and reportedly in Rome.The depraved practice of bestiality is included in the Greek word <em>por&#xB7;nei&#x2B9;a </em>that is rendered &#x201C;fornication.&#x201D; (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000664/0\">FORNICATION</a>.) Anyone indulging in such filthy practice is morally unclean, and if a member of the Christian congregation was to indulge in such a practice, that one would be subject to disfellowshipping.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000664/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 5:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000664/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Col 3:5,&#xA0;6</a>."}
