The leaves are small, oval, and leathery, and at the base of each leaf is a pair of thorns. The only reference to it is at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002779/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 40:21, 22</a>, which speaks of Behemoth (the hippopotamus) as lying in the shade cast by the tree. While this tree is found in dry places in Palestine, <em>A Dictionary of Life in Bible Times </em>speaks of it as &#x201C;flourishing in the hot and humid marshland&#x201D; of N Africa.<wbr>&#x2014;By W.&#xA0;Corswant, Suffolk, 1960, p.&#xA0;177."}
