Early saws did not cut in both directions; some were designed to cut when pulled toward the user; others, when pushed away. Egyptian saws were generally made of bronze and usually had teeth that slanted in the direction of the handle. Such a saw would cut when drawn toward the person using it. The blade was either inserted in the handle or fastened to it by means of thongs. Two-handled saws having iron blades were in use among the Assyrians. Hebrew carpenters employed the saw to cut wood, and their masons used saws capable of cutting stone.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003849/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 10:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003849/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 7:9</a>.David put captive Ammonites to work at such tasks as sawing stones.

In some cases it appears that copper-bladed saws with stone teeth were used to cut stone. But apparently an abrasive such as emery powder was sometimes put under the cutting edge of a saw having a copper or a bronze blade so as to facilitate the cutting of stone.Persecution of faithful pre-Christian witnesses of Jehovah was so severe at times that some were killed by being &#x201C;sawn asunder.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003849/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 11:37,&#xA0;38</a>) According to tradition, wicked King Manasseh had Isaiah put to death in that extremely painful manner, though the Scriptures do not say so."}
