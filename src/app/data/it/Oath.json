The word itself carries no connotation of a curse upon the one swearing if he fails to fulfill the oath. This is the word used for the oath, or sworn statement, to Abraham by Jehovah, who never fails to fulfill his word and upon whom no curse can come.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 26:3</a>.The other Hebrew word used is <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;lah&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;oath, cursing.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 24:41</a>, ftn) It may also be translated &#x201C;oath of obligation.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 26:28</a>) A Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon by Koehler and Baumgartner (p.&#xA0;49) defines the term as a &#x201C;curse (threat of calamity in case of misdeed), laid on a p[erson] by himself or by others.&#x201D; In ancient Hebrew times it was considered the gravest matter to make an oath. An oath was to be kept, even to the oath taker&#x2019;s hurt. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 15:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 5:33</a>) A person was held guilty before Jehovah if he spoke thoughtlessly in a sworn statement. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Le 5:4</a>) Violation of an oath would bring the most severe consequences of punishment from God. Among the earliest nations and particularly among the Hebrews an oath was in a sense a religious act, involving God. The use of the term <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;lah&#x2B9; </em>by the Hebrews by implication made God a party to the oath and professed a readiness to incur any judgment he might be pleased to inflict in event of the oath maker&#x2019;s infidelity. This term is never used by God with reference to his own oaths.The corresponding Greek terms are <em>hor&#x2B9;kos </em>(oath) and <em>o&#xB7;mny&#x2B9;o </em>(swear), which both occur in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">James 5:12</a>.

It had become common among them to swear by heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, and even by their own heads. But since heaven was &#x201C;God&#x2019;s throne,&#x201D; earth his &#x201C;footstool,&#x201D; Jerusalem his kingly city, and one&#x2019;s head (or life) was dependent on God, making such oaths was the same as taking oaths in the name of God. It was not to be treated lightly. So Jesus said: &#x201C;Just let your word <em>Yes </em>mean Yes, your <em>No, </em>No; for what is in excess of these is from the wicked one.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:33-37</a>.<span id=\"page518\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"518\" data-before-text=\"518\"></span>Jesus Christ did not hereby prohibit the making of all oaths, for he himself was under the Law of Moses, which required oaths under certain circumstances. In fact, when Jesus himself was on trial he was put under oath by the high priest, yet he did not object to this, but gave an answer. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:63,&#xA0;64</a>) Rather, Jesus was showing that a person should not have two standards. The keeping of one&#x2019;s word, once given, should be viewed as a sacred duty and should be fulfilled just as an oath would be; the person should sincerely mean what he says. He shed further light on the meaning of his words when he exposed the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees by saying to them: &#x201C;Woe to you, blind guides, who say, &#x2018;If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is under obligation.&#x2019; Fools and blind ones! Which, in fact, is greater, the gold or the temple that has sanctified the gold?&#x201D; He went on to say: &#x201C;He that swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of God and by him that is sitting on it.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 23:16-22</a>.By the false reasoning and hairsplitting casuistry of these scribes and Pharisees, as here pointed out by Jesus, they justified themselves in failing to carry out certain oaths, but Jesus showed that such swearing on their part was being dishonest with God and was actually reproaching his name (for the Jews were a people dedicated to Jehovah). Jehovah plainly states that he hates a false oath.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 8:17</a>.James corroborates Jesus&#x2019; words. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 5:12</a>) But these statements of Jesus and James against such indiscriminate practices do not prevent the Christian from taking an oath when necessary to assure others of the seriousness of his intentions or of the truthfulness of what he says. For instance, as Jesus illustrated by example before the Jewish high priest, a Christian would not object to taking an oath in court, for he is going to speak the truth whether under oath or not. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:63,&#xA0;64</a>) Even the Christian resolve to serve God is an oath or a swearing to Jehovah, putting the Christian into a sacred relationship. Jesus put swearing and vows in the same category.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:33</a>.Also, the apostle Paul, in order to strengthen his testimony before his readers, makes what is tantamount to an oath at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Corinthians 1:23</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Galatians 1:20</a>. He further refers to an oath as a customary and proper way of putting an end to a dispute and calls attention to the fact that God, &#x201C;when he purposed to demonstrate more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his counsel, stepped in with an oath,&#x201D; swearing by himself, since he could not swear by anyone greater. This added to his promise a legal guarantee and gave double assurance by means of &#x201C;two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie,&#x201D; namely, God&#x2019;s word of promise and his oath. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 6:13-18</a>) Furthermore, Paul points out that Christ was made High Priest by oath of Jehovah and has been given in pledge of a better covenant. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:21,&#xA0;22</a>) The Scriptures make upwards of 50 references to Jehovah himself as making oaths.On the night of Jesus&#x2019; arrest, the apostle Peter three times denied knowing Jesus, finally giving way to cursing and swearing. We read concerning the third denial: &#x201C;Then [Peter] started to curse and swear: &#x2018;I do not know the man [Jesus]!&#x2019;&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:74</a>) Peter was fearfully trying to convince those around him that his denials were truthful. By swearing to the matter, he was taking an oath that his words were true and that a calamity might befall him if they were not.<wbr>&#x2014;See also <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003286/2\">CURSE</a>."}
