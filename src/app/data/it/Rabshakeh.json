(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:17</a>) A building inscription of the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser&#xA0;III says: &#x201C;I sent an officer of mine, the <em>rabsaq, </em>to Tyre.&#x201D; Also, from a tablet in the British Museum an inscription of King Ashurbanipal reads: &#x201C;I ordered to add to my former (battle-) forces (in Egypt) the <em>rabsaq </em>-officer.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Pritchard, 1974, pp.&#xA0;282, 296.While Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, was laying siege to the Judean fortress of Lachish, he sent a heavy military force to Jerusalem under the Tartan, the commander-in-chief, along with two other high officials, the Rabsaris and the Rabshakeh. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:17</a>; the entire account appears also at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa chaps 36,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;37</a>.) Of these three superior Assyrian officials, Rabshakeh was the chief spokesman in an effort to force King Hezekiah to capitulate in surrender. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:19-25</a>) The three stood by the conduit of the upper pool. This Rabshakeh, whose personal name is not revealed, was a fluent speaker in Hebrew as well as Syrian. He called out in Hebrew to King Hezekiah, but three of Hezekiah&#x2019;s officials came out to meet him. King Hezekiah&#x2019;s officers asked Rabshakeh to speak to them in the Syrian language rather than in the Jews&#x2019; language because the common people on the wall were listening. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:26,&#xA0;27</a>) But the situation suited Rabshakeh&#x2019;s purpose as a propagandist. He wanted the people to hear, with a view to demoralizing their ranks. By words calculated to induce terror, by false promises and lies, by reproach, and by ridicule of Jehovah, Rabshakeh spoke even more loudly in Hebrew, submitting arguments to the people to turn traitor to King Hezekiah by surrendering to the Assyrian army. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:28-35</a>) <span id=\"page726\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"726\" data-before-text=\"726\"></span>Nevertheless, the people of Jerusalem remained loyal to Hezekiah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:36</a>.The taunting words of Rabshakeh were taken by Hezekiah to Jehovah in prayer, and a delegation was sent to the prophet Isaiah to receive Jehovah&#x2019;s reply. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:37;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:1-7</a>) In the meantime Rabshakeh was quickly called away when he heard that the king of Assyria had pulled away from Lachish and was fighting against Libnah. Keeping up his propaganda campaign against Hezekiah from a distance, Sennacherib sent messengers to Jerusalem with letters of continued taunt and strong threat to bring Hezekiah to surrender. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 19:8-13</a>) King Hezekiah took the letters to the temple of Jerusalem and spread them before Jehovah along with his urgent prayer for help. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 19:14-19</a>) Jehovah gave his answer through the prophet Isaiah that the king of Assyria &#x201C;will not come into this city nor will he shoot an arrow there nor confront it with a shield nor cast up a siege rampart against it. By the way by which he proceeded to come, he will return, and into this city he will not come, is the utterance of Jehovah.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 19:32,&#xA0;33</a>) That night the angel of Jehovah struck down in death 185,000 soldiers of the Assyrians. This unexpected mighty blow caused Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, to withdraw immediately and return to Nineveh, Assyria&#x2019;s capital, where Sennacherib was assassinated sometime later. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003618/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 19:35-37</a>) As a blasphemous taunter of the living God Jehovah, Rabshakeh&#x2019;s efforts came to nothing."}
