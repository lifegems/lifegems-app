Zeruiah&#x2019;s sister Abigail is said to be &#x201C;the daughter of Nahash,&#x201D; though that is not directly stated of Zeruiah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004717/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 17:25</a>) Zeruiah and Abigail are also said to be &#x201C;sisters&#x201D; of the sons of Jesse. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004717/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 2:16</a>) It is possible, therefore, that they were daughters of Jesse&#x2019;s wife by a previous marriage to Nahash, therefore only half sisters of David. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004717/0\">ABIGAIL</a> No.&#xA0;2; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004717/1\">NAHASH</a> No.&#xA0;2.) Apparently Zeruiah was considerably older than David, for her sons seem to have been about the same age as David. Zeruiah&#x2019;s name is usually associated with her three sons, who were all valiant fighters for David.
