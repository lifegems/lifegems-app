Most commonly, it is applied in a topographical sense to a prominent hill or promontory. A form of the term is also applied to the swelling or bulging of body veins known as piles, or hemorrhoids.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003335/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 28:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003335/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 5:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003335/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003335/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003335/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> 6:4,&#xA0;5</a>.There was a particular hill or eminence located at or near Jerusalem that was called <em>ha&#xB7;&#x2BD;O&#x2B9;phel, </em>or Ophel. The Scriptural indications taken with the comments of Josephus locate Ophel at the SE corner of Moriah.

Nevertheless, Isaiah prophesied that &#x201C;Ophel,&#x201D; apparently that of Jerusalem, would become a &#x2018;bare field.&#x2019;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003335/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 32:14</a>; compare the reference to the tower and &#x201C;mound&#x201D; (<em>&#x2BD;O&#x2B9;phel</em>) at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003335/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 4:8</a>.Scholars believe that the term <em>&#x2BD;O&#x2B9;phel </em>at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003335/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Kings 5:24</a> refers to some prominent hill or fortified place in the vicinity of Samaria to which Elisha&#x2019;s attendant Gehazi took the riches he obtained from Naaman. This indicates that the word was applied to mounds other than the one in Jerusalem."}
