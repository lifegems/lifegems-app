The Greek vowel <em>o&#x2B9;mi&#xB7;kron </em>(&#x201C;o&#x201D;) is derived from <em>&#x2BD;a&#x2B9;yin; </em>however, the Hebrew letter is not a vowel but a <em>consonant. </em>It represents a peculiar guttural sound pronounced at the back of the throat and has no equivalent in English. It is transliterated as &#x2BD;. It appears as the initial letter in each of the verses of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000482/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 119:121-128</a>, Hebrew text."}
