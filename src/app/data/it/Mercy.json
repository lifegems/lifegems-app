An examination of these terms and their usage helps bring out their full flavor and sense. The Hebrew verb <em>ra&#xB7;cham&#x2B9; </em>is defined as meaning &#x201C;to glow, to feel warm with tender emotion; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. to be compassionate.&#x201D; (<em>A Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon, </em>edited by B.&#xA0;Davies, 1957, p.&#xA0;590) According to lexicographer Gesenius: &#x201C;The primary idea seems to lie in cherishing, soothing, and in a gentle emotion of mind.&#x201D; (<em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, </em>translated by E.&#xA0;Robinson, 1836, p.&#xA0;939) The term is closely related to the word for &#x201C;womb&#x201D; or can refer to &#x201C;bowels,&#x201D; which are affected when one feels warm and tender sympathy or pity.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 63:15, 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 31:20</a>.In the Scriptures <em>ra&#xB7;cham&#x2B9; </em>is used only once by man toward God, the psalmist saying: &#x201C;I shall have affection [form of <em>ra&#xB7;cham&#x2B9;</em>] for you, O&#xA0;Jehovah my strength.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 18:1</a>) Between humans, Joseph displayed this quality when &#x201C;his inward emotions [form of <em>ra&#xB7;chamim&#x2B9;</em>] were excited&#x201D; toward his brother Benjamin and he gave way to tears.

Vine&#x2019;s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words </em>says: &#x201C;ELEOS (&#x1F14;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;) &#x2018;is the outward manifestation of pity; it assumes need on the part of him who receives it, and resources adequate to meet the need on the part of him who shows it.&#x2019;&#x201D; The verb (<em>e&#xB7;le&#xB7;e&#x2B9;o</em>) generally conveys the idea of feeling &#x201C;sympathy with the misery of another, and especially sympathy manifested in act.&#x201D; (1981, Vol.&#xA0;3, pp.&#xA0;60,&#xA0;61) Hence, the blind, the demon-possessed, the leprous, or those whose children were afflicted were among those who evoked <em>e&#x2B9;le&#xB7;os, </em>the expression of mercy, pity. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 9:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 17:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/10/3\" data-bid=\"11-4\" class=\"b\"> Mr 5:18, 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/10/4\" data-bid=\"11-5\" class=\"b\"> Lu 17:12,&#xA0;13</a>) In response to the plea, &#x201C;Have mercy on us,&#x201D; Jesus performed miracles relieving such ones.

Thus, it frequently has a judicial flavor, as when a judge shows clemency in softening the judgment upon a wrongdoer. Since God&#x2019;s exercise of mercy is always in harmony with his other qualities and righteous standards, including his justice and trueness (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 40:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> Ho 2:19</a>), and since all men are by inheritance sinful and worthy of receiving sin&#x2019;s payment of death (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:12</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 130:3,&#xA0;4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Da 9:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/15/2\" data-bid=\"16-3\" class=\"b\"> Tit 3:5</a>), it is clear that the pardoning of error, or the lightening of judgment or punishment, is frequently involved in God&#x2019;s exercise of mercy. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 51:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> 103:3,&#xA0;4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/16/2\" data-bid=\"17-3\" class=\"b\"> Da 9:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/16/3\" data-bid=\"17-4\" class=\"b\"> Mic 7:18,&#xA0;19</a>) However, it can be seen from the preceding information that the Hebrew and Greek terms (<em>ra&#xB7;chamim&#x2B9;; e&#x2B9;le&#xB7;os</em>) are not limited to forgiveness or restraint in applying a judicial penalty. Pardon of error of itself is not the mercy generally portrayed by these terms, but, rather, such forgiveness opens the way for that mercy. In expressing mercy, God, of course, never ignores his perfect standards of justice, and for this reason he has provided the ransom sacrifice through his Son Jesus Christ, making possible the forgiveness of sins with no violation of justice.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 3:25,&#xA0;26</a>.Mercy, then, most frequently refers, not to a negative action, a holding back (as of punishment), but to a positive action, to an expression of kind consideration or pity that brings relief to those who are disadvantaged, in need of mercy.This is well illustrated in Jesus&#x2019; parable of the Samaritan who saw the traveler lying by the roadside, robbed and beaten. He showed himself &#x201C;neighbor&#x201D; to the man because, moved with pity, he &#x201C;acted mercifully toward him,&#x201D; treating his wounds and caring for him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002994/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 10:29-37</a>) No forgiveness of wrongdoing or judicial proceedings were involved.Hence, the Scriptures show that the mercifulness of Jehovah God is not a quality that comes into play only when persons are, in effect, &#x201C;on trial&#x201D; before him because of having committed some particular wrong. Rather, it is a characteristic quality of God&#x2019;s personality, his normal way of reacting toward those in need, a facet of his love.
