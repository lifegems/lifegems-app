{"title":"Ash Constellation","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000411","html":"<span id=\"page189\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"189\" data-before-text=\"189\"></span><strong>ASH CONSTELLATION</strong>The fact that the Hebrew words <em>&#x2BD;Ash </em>and <em>&#x2BD;A&#x2B9;yish </em>as well as other terms are used in association with sun, stars, and heaven in both cases indicates that they refer to some celestial constellation. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000411/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 9:7-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000411/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 38:32,&#xA0;33</a>.) It is impossible at present to specify which constellation they refer to and hence it is safer to transliterate the name (as in our heading) rather than to translate the Hebrew with specific names such as &#x201C;Arcturus&#x201D; (Gr., <em>Ar&#xB7;ktou&#x2B9;ros, </em>literally meaning &#x201C;Guardian of the Bear&#x201D;) (<em>KJ</em>), or &#x201C;Bear&#x201D; (<em>RS</em>).The fact that <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000411/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job 38:32</a> refers to Ash &#x201C;alongside its sons&#x201D; strengthens the basis for believing that a constellation is involved. Ursa Major (the Great Bear) is the constellation most often suggested, having seven main stars in it that could be &#x201C;its sons.&#x201D; The important point in the text is, not the precise identification of the constellation, but the question there raised: &#x201C;Can you conduct them?&#x201D; Jehovah God thus impresses upon Job the wisdom and power of the Creator, inasmuch as it is utterly impossible for man to govern the movements of these immense stellar bodies."}
