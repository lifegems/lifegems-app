(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000742/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 10:12-14</a>) Its name apparently indicates a house where the sheep were bound to facilitate the work of shearing. Some versions render <em>behth-&#x2BD;e&#x2B9;qedh </em>as &#x201C;meeting house,&#x201D; indicating an inn where &#x201C;the shepherds&#x201D; (<em>ha&#xB7;ro&#xB7;&#x2BD;im&#x2B9;</em>) met; others simply transliterate the Hebrew name, viewing it as the name of a town. It is generally identified with Beit Qad (Bet Qad) about 6&#xA0;km (3.5 mi) ENE of modern Jenin. There are several cisterns at this place."}
