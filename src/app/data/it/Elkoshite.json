(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001327/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Na 1:1</a>) Some would place Elkosh in Galilee. However, Nahum may have been in Judah at the time he wrote the book bearing his name. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001327/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Na 1:15</a>) If so, this would make the suggested identity with Judean site Beit Jibrin (Bet Guvrin), about 6&#xA0;km (3.5&#xA0;mi) NE of Lachish, the most likely proposal. The identification, however, remains tentative."}
