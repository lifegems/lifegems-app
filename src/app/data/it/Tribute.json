(For a consideration of the original-language words, see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/0\">TAXATION</a>.) Nations exacting tribute from other peoples frequently received gold and silver or products that were in short supply in their own land. In this way they strengthened their economic position while keeping the subjugated nations weak by drawing heavily on their resources.Judean Kings David (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 8:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;6</a>), Solomon (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 72:10</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:23-25</a>), Jehoshaphat (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 17:10,&#xA0;11</a>), and Uzziah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 26:8</a>), as well as Israelite King Ahab (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004478/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 3:4,&#xA0;5</a>), received tribute from other peoples. However, on account of unfaithfulness, the Israelites were often in an inferior position and were forced to pay tribute to others. As early as the time of the Judges, while under the domination of Moabite King Eglon, they paid tribute.
