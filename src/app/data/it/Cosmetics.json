Such preparations can be applied to the skin, the nails, or the hair. The English word &#x201C;cosmetic&#x201D; is derived from the Greek word <em>ko&#xB7;sme&#xB7;ti&#xB7;kos&#x2B9;, </em>which means &#x201C;skilled in decorating.&#x201D;There were ointment makers and mixers among the Israelites (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 8:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Ne 3:8</a>), and ointments (often scented) were widely used, perhaps more so than other cosmetics. When applied to the skin or the hair in a hot, dry climate, ointments would help to cope with dryness. Perfumed oils were in use, a sinful woman once anointing Jesus Christ&#x2019;s feet with such oil.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 23:40</a>) Eye paint was often black, which color would contrast with the white of the eye and tend to make the eyes look larger. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 4:30</a>) Scriptural references to eye painting do not associate the practice with faithful women of Israel in general, though one of Job&#x2019;s daughters was named Keren-happuch, which possibly means &#x201C;Horn of the Black (Eye) Paint [that is, a receptacle for makeup].&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 42:14</a>.Modest and tasteful use of cosmetics and articles of adornment is not Scripturally condemned. However, Paul and Peter admonished Christian women to adorn themselves &#x201C;with modesty and soundness of mind, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. in the way that befits women professing to reverence God,&#x201D; and to let their adornment be &#x201C;the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible apparel of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 2:9, 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 3:3,&#xA0;4</a>) And, in the inspired appraisal of the good wife, it is fittingly stated: &#x201C;Charm may be false, and prettiness may be vain; but the woman that fears Jehovah is the one that procures praise for herself.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001046/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 31:30</a>."}
