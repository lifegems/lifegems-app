Rhoda was a servant girl, presumably in the household of Mark&#x2019;s mother Mary. At least she was one of those who spent the night there praying for Peter.

All the while Peter kept knocking until they finally let him in.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003725/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 12:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003725/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003725/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 12-16</a>."}
