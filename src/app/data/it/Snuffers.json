(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 25:37, 38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 37:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Nu 4:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 7:48, 49;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 4:19-21</a>) The snuffers are designated by the dual Hebrew word <em>mel&#xB7;qa&#xB7;cha&#x2B9;yim, </em>derived from a root meaning &#x201C;take.&#x201D; Use of the dual form suggests a device possibly having two parts. Accordingly, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 6:6</a> <em>mel&#xB7;qa&#xB7;cha&#x2B9;yim </em>denotes the &#x201C;tongs&#x201D; with which a seraph removed a glowing coal from the altar.A distinction is drawn between the lampstand &#x201C;snuffers&#x201D; and &#x201C;the extinguishers&#x201D; in use at the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 7:49, 50;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 4:21,&#xA0;22</a>) Though not described in Scripture, the snuffers may have been tongs used to hold the burnt lampwicks, while the extinguishers may have been scissorlike utensils employed to cut off the burnt part of the wicks. At the tabernacle, these trimmings, held by means of the snuffers, were deposited in fire holders, apparently containers for holding such pieces until their disposal.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004171/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 37:23</a>."}
