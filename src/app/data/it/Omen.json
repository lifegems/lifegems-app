(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 30:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Nu 24:1</a>) Looking for omens, as a form of divination, was specifically prohibited by God&#x2019;s law to Israel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Le 19:26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> De 18:10</a>) But apostates like Judean King Manasseh did look for omens. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:6</a>) Since this practice is condemned in the Scriptures, evidently faithful Joseph&#x2019;s comment about use of his silver cup to read omens was merely part of a ruse. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 44:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;15</a>) By making the comment, Joseph represented himself, not as one having faith in Jehovah, but as an administrator of a land where false worship prevailed. He thus gave no hint of having anything in common with his brothers and kept his true identity concealed from them.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003322/0\">DIVINATION</a>."}
