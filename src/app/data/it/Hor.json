With the assembly of Israel watching, Aaron, Moses, and Aaron&#x2019;s son Eleazar ascended Mount Hor. On the mountaintop Moses removed Aaron&#x2019;s priestly garments and clothed Eleazar with them. After this, Aaron died, and Moses and Eleazar probably buried him there.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002071/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 20:22-29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002071/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> De 32:50</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002071/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">De 10:6</a>.According to the historian Josephus, Mount Hor was one of the high mountains encompassing the Edomite city of Petra. (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>IV, 82, 83 [iv,&#xA0;7]) Tradition has linked it with Jebel Harun (meaning &#x201C;Mountain of Aaron&#x201D;), a twin-topped, red sandstone mountain having an elevation of some 1,460&#xA0;m (4,790&#xA0;ft) and situated less than 5&#xA0;km (3&#xA0;mi) WSW of Petra. However, Jebel Harun does not seem to fit the Biblical description of Israel&#x2019;s coming from Kadesh (Kadesh-barnea) to Mount Hor &#x201C;on the frontier of the land of Edom.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002071/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 33:37-39,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002071/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;41</a>) Jebel Harun is not on Edom&#x2019;s border, but within that country. Thus for Israel to have reached this traditional site would have meant trespassing on Edom&#x2019;s territory. But this could not have occurred, since the Israelites had previously been denied passage through Edom. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002071/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 20:14-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002071/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> De 2:5-8</a>) Hence, many scholars favor as a possible identification the isolated, steep-sided white chalk Jebel Madurah (Har Zin [Hor Ha Har]), a mountain about 40&#xA0;km (25&#xA0;mi) SW of the Dead Sea, and about 60&#xA0;km (37&#xA0;mi) ENE of Kadesh.<strong>2. </strong>A mountain marking the northern extremity of Canaan. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002071/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 34:7,&#xA0;8</a>) No certain identification can be made. Some scholars believe that this Mount Hor (Heb., <em>Hor ha&#xB7;har&#x2B9;</em>) may be the same <span id=\"page1141\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1141\" data-before-text=\"1141\"></span>as Mount Hermon. Others suggest that it perhaps designates the entire Lebanon Range or a prominent peak thereof."}
