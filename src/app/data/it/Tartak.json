(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004327/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:31</a>) According to the Babylonian Talmud, Tartak had the form of an ass. (<em>Sanhedrin </em>63<em>b</em>) Based on the conclusion that the name Tartak may be comparable to the Pahlavi (Persian) word <em>tar-thakh </em>(intense darkness, hero of darkness), it has been suggested that Tartak may have been a demon of the lower regions. Aside from the brief reference to Tartak in the Scriptures, however, nothing can be stated with any certainty concerning the nature of this deity."}
