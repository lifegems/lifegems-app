Concerning the revelation of &#x201C;the sacred secret,&#x201D; the apostle Paul wrote: &#x201C;In other generations this secret was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by spirit, namely, that people of the nations should be joint heirs and fellow members of the body and partakers with us of the promise in union with Christ Jesus through the good news.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003716/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 3:1-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003716/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 16:25</a>.The book of Acts forcefully confirms that this revelation of the sacred secret resulted from the operation of God&#x2019;s spirit. It had been at the spirit&#x2019;s direction that Peter, Paul, and Barnabas preached to non-Jews. Believing non-Jews, &#x201C;people of the nations,&#x201D; received holy spirit while in an uncircumcised state, thereby becoming a people for God&#x2019;s name.

In each case, the revealing, or revelation, is a time for causing righteous persons to enter into particular rewards and blessings or for bringing destruction upon wicked ones.<strong>Of the Sons of God. </strong>In his letter to the Romans, the apostle Paul identified God&#x2019;s &#x201C;sons&#x201D; as those having received a spirit of adoption. Being joint heirs with Christ, these sons of God will be glorified. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003716/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:14-18</a>) The Lord Jesus Christ will refashion their humiliated body to conform to his glorious body (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003716/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Php 3:20,&#xA0;21</a>), and they will reign with him as kings. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003716/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 2:12</a>) So &#x201C;the revealing of the sons of God&#x201D; points to the time when it will become evident that they have indeed been glorified and are reigning with Christ Jesus. The glory that will be revealed in them will be so grand that it will make all their former suffering on earth seem like nothing.

He is thus revealed as a glorious King, empowered to reward and to punish. The Scriptures show that spirit-anointed Christians who faithfully endured suffering would be &#x201C;overjoyed&#x201D; during the revelation of Christ&#x2019;s glory. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003716/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 4:13</a>) The tested quality of their faith would be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ, and these Christians would become recipients of undeserved kindness.
