(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000428/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:5</a>) Some have supposed it to be the full name for Ashtaroth and that the addition of &#x201C;karnaim&#x201D; (horns) refers to the two horns of the crescent moon symbolizing the goddess Astarte or to twin peaks adjacent to the town. However, it is also suggested that the name means &#x201C;Ashteroth Near Karnaim&#x201D; and that it thus refers to the city of Ashtaroth with Karnaim being mentioned as a separate but adjacent town. Karnaim is considered to be located at Sheikh Sa&#x2BD;ad, which lies in the vicinity of the generally accepted site of Ashtaroth (Tell &#x2BD;Ashtarah).<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000428/0\">ASHTAROTH</a>."}
