{"title":"Moth","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003122","html":"<span id=\"page442\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"442\" data-before-text=\"442\"></span><strong>MOTH</strong>[Heb., <em>&#x2BD;ash; sas </em>(clothes moth); Gr., <em>ses</em>].A four-winged insect resembling a butterfly but differing from the latter in that its feelers usually are feathery and not terminated by distinct knobs. When at rest the moth&#x2019;s wings are not held erect, as is often the case with butterflies. Instead, they are either folded back flat over the insect&#x2019;s body or held flat at its sides. Also, moths are generally nocturnal. The insect referred to in Scripture is evidently the webbing clothes moth (<em>Tineola bisselliella</em>), particularly in its destructive larval stage.

The caterpillars will not eat until they have first protected themselves with a &#x201C;house&#x201D; or case constructed from the available fibers. In this &#x201C;house&#x201D; they remain as they feed.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003122/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Job 27:18</a>."}
