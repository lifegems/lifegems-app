The principal Hebrew verb having to do with legal cases is <em>riv, </em>meaning &#x201C;quarrel; contend; conduct a legal case.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 26:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> De 33:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Pr 25:8</a>) The noun form is rendered &#x201C;controversy; dispute; case at law; legal case.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 23:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> De 17:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Ps 35:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> Isa 34:8</a>) The Hebrew word <em>din </em>(judgment) is sometimes rendered &#x201C;legal case; legal claim; legal contest.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Job 35:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 140:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Pr 22:10</a>) A legal case, among God&#x2019;s servants, had as its primary purpose the satisfying of the divine requirements and, secondarily, the rendering of justice to the person or persons involved, along with compensation where such was due. God considered himself involved in even personal offenses between humans, as is noted in Moses&#x2019; words to Israelite judges at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 1:16,&#xA0;17</a>.A legal case was conducted in the garden of Eden, to bring out the facts of that case and the issues involved, to establish them as a matter of public record, and also to pass sentence on the offenders. Jehovah called Adam and Eve before him for questioning. Though he knew all, he held a hearing, made the charges clear, brought out the facts by questioning, and gave them an opportunity to make expression in their own defense. He obtained a confession from the offenders. Jehovah then made his decision in the matter and, with justice and undeserved kindness, applied the law, exercising mercy toward Adam and Eve&#x2019;s unborn offspring by deferring the execution of the death sentence upon the offenders for a time.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:6-19</a>.Jehovah God the Supreme Judge here set the pattern for all further judicial proceedings among his people. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:1-24</a>) Legal cases conducted according to God&#x2019;s judicial regulations were for the finding and discussion of facts for the purpose of rendering justice<wbr>&#x2014;where possible, justice tempered with mercy.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:25</a>) Jesus gave such counsel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 18:15-17</a>) There was no formal or complicated procedure in conducting legal cases, either during the pre-Mosaic period or under the Law, although some formalism did creep in after the establishment of the Sanhedrin. Nevertheless, cases were conducted in an orderly and purposeful manner. The courts were open to women, to slaves, and to the alien resident, so that justice might be administered to all.

No equivalent of <span id=\"page234\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"234\" data-before-text=\"234\"></span>a public prosecutor appears in either patriarchal or Israelite courts; neither was an attorney for the defense necessary. Proceedings were without court costs to the litigants.A person with a civil matter or a complainant in a criminal matter would bring his case to the judges. The other party would be called, witnesses were gathered together, and the hearing was conducted usually in a public place, most often at the city gates.

They would render a verdict without delay unless evidence was lacking, or if the matter was too difficult, the judges would refer the case to a higher court. Sentences, such as flogging and the death penalty, were carried out immediately. There was no provision in the Law for imprisonment. Custody was employed only in a case in which Jehovah had to be consulted for a decision.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Le 24:12</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/0\">COURT, JUDICIAL</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/1\">CRIME AND PUNISHMENT</a>.Guilt always brought liability; there were no exceptions. Guilt could not be overlooked. Wherever the Law demanded it, punishment had to be administered or, in some cases, compensation made. Then the guilty one, in order to make peace with God, was required to present an offering at the sanctuary. Sacrifices for atonement were required in any case of guilt.

Thus witnesses were enjoined by law to demonstrate their zeal for true, clean worship and for clearing out what was bad in Israel. This would also act as a deterrent to false testimony. It would take a very callous person to make a false accusation, knowing that he had to be the first to act in putting the accused to death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">De 17:7</a>.<strong><em>Material and circumstantial evidence. </em></strong>In case livestock had been entrusted to the care of another, the responsible one could bring in the torn body of an animal that had been killed by a wild beast as evidence, and that would thereby relieve him of liability.

It was not a trial by ordeal. There was nothing in the <em>procedure itself </em>that would harm the woman or make manifest her innocence or guilt, but it was Jehovah who judged the woman and made known his verdict. If she was innocent, she would be unharmed and was to be made pregnant by her husband. If she was guilty, her reproductive organs would be affected so that she would be incapable of pregnancy. If there had been the required two witnesses, the matter would not have been taken to Jehovah in this manner, but she would have been adjudged <span id=\"page235\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"235\" data-before-text=\"235\"></span>guilty by the judges and stoned to death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 5:11-31</a>.<strong><em>Documents. </em></strong>Records, or documents, of various kinds were used.

Prior to his trial the chief priests and older men of the people took counsel together with a view to putting Jesus to death. So the judges were prejudiced and had their minds made up on the verdict before ever the trial took place. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:3,&#xA0;4</a>) They bribed Judas to betray Jesus to them.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 18:13</a>) There Jesus was questioned and was slapped in the face. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 18:22</a>) Next he was led bound to Caiaphas the high priest. False witnesses were sought by the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin. Many such witnesses came forward but could not agree on their testimony, except two who twisted Jesus&#x2019; words recorded at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">John 2:19</a>.

When Jesus answered in the affirmative and alluded to the prophecy at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Daniel 7:13</a>, the high priest ripped his garments and called upon the court to find Jesus guilty of blasphemy. This verdict was rendered, and he was sentenced to death. After this they spit in his face and hit him with their fists, taunting him, contrary to the Law.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:57-68;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/48/1\" data-bid=\"49-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 22:66-71</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">De 25:1, 2</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 7:51</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 23:3</a>.After this illegal night trial the Sanhedrin met early in the morning to confirm their judgment and for a consultation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 15:1</a>) Jesus was now led, again bound, to the governor&#x2019;s palace, to Pilate, since they said: &#x201C;It is not lawful for us to kill anyone.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 18:31</a>) Here Jesus was charged with forbidding the paying of taxes to Caesar and with saying that he himself was Christ a king. Blasphemy against the God of the Jews would not have been so serious a charge in the eyes of the Romans, but sedition would. Pilate, after making futile attempts to get Jesus to testify against himself, told the Jews that he found no crime in him. Discovering, however, that Jesus was a Galilean, Pilate was happy to send him to Herod, who had jurisdiction over Galilee. Herod questioned Jesus, hoping to see a sign performed by him, but Jesus refused. Herod then discredited Jesus, making fun of him, and sent him back to Pilate.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002713/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 23:1-11</a>.Pilate now tried to release Jesus in harmony with a custom of that time, but the Jews refused, calling for the release of a seditionist and murderer instead.
