It was used for food, clothing, and other provisions, but it was not the same as the smaller girdle purse used for gold, silver, and copper coins. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 6:8</a>) David&#x2019;s &#x201C;shepherds&#x2019; bag&#x201D; was doubtless such a food pouch. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:40</a>) Jesus Christ, when sending out first the 12 apostles and then the 70 disciples to preach in Israel, told them not to carry food pouches. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 9, 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 9:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/2/4\" data-bid=\"3-5\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;4</a>) Jehovah would care for their needs through the hands of fellow Israelites, among whom hospitality was a custom. Just before his death Jesus indicated that circumstances would change <span id=\"page846\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"846\" data-before-text=\"846\"></span>as a result of official opposition, so he told his disciples to take along both purse and food pouch. Nevertheless, they were to seek first God&#x2019;s Kingdom instead of being anxious about material needs; thus they would give evidence that they depended upon Jehovah God to care for them in the ministry.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 22:35, 36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001542/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 6:25-34</a>."}
