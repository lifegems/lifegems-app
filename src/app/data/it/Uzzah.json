Uzzah and his brother Ahio led the wagon carrying the ark of the covenant from their house when David wanted it brought to Jerusalem. When the bulls pulling the wagon nearly caused an upset, Uzzah reached out and grabbed hold to steady the Ark, for which Jehovah struck him dead on the spot. David named the place Perez-uzzah because there Jehovah had broken through in &#x201C;a rupture against Uzzah.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004531/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 6:3-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004531/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 13:7-11</a>.Notwithstanding Uzzah&#x2019;s presumably good intentions to prevent the Ark from falling, it was judged as an &#x201C;irreverent act.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004531/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 6:7</a>) This was because deliberate disobedience was involved.
