Emerald is composed of aluminum and beryllium silicate and a small amount of chromium that imparts the green color to the stone. It is slightly harder than quartz and is usually found in nodular form or in distinct six-sided crystals.Emeralds were known to the early Egyptians, who obtained them from Upper Egypt. They were probably among the valuable articles received from the Egyptians just prior to Israel&#x2019;s departure from Egypt.
