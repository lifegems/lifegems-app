(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:62;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 24:1</a>) The city is usually identified with Tell Jurn (Tel Goren), near the modern settlement of &#x2BD;En Gedi, about 37&#xA0;km (23&#xA0;mi) SSE of Jerusalem on the shore of the Dead Sea.The Shulammite maiden alluded to the fruitfulness of the region, referring to &#x201C;a cluster of henna .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. among the vineyards of En-gedi.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 1:14</a>) This, however, only partly describes the rich plant life that flourishes there even today. En-gedi&#x2019;s particular location in the depression of the region of the Dead Sea is conducive to the growth of semitropical vegetation, palms and balsam, plus a variety of fruits, making En-gedi an oasis that stands out from the nearby severely desolate Wilderness of Judah.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/0\">JUDAH, WILDERNESS OF</a>.Not only this abundant growth but also the inaccessibility of the region made En-gedi an ideal hideout for David when he was being pursued by King Saul. Thus the Bible speaks of certain &#x201C;places difficult to approach at En-gedi.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 23:29</a>) Modern-day visitors have similarly depicted the dangerous and precipitous rocky passes in that area. The hostility of parts of the terrain is also indicated by the reference to &#x201C;the bare rocks of the mountain goats.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 24:2</a>) Some scholars consider this a proper name, &#x201C;Rocks of the Wild Goats&#x201D; (<em>AT, JB, RS</em>), referring to some particular locality where goats were likely to congregate, as they do even in modern times in the En-gedi region. However, others view this term as simply a descriptive phrase for the region&#x2019;s goat-inhabited, rough, conical mountains and ridges. The rocks of En-gedi are honeycombed with roomy caves. David and his men may have hidden in one of these. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 24:3</a>) Some suggest that &#x201C;the stone sheepfolds&#x201D; where Saul stopped may refer to these caves, with a rough wall built in front to give weather protection.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 24:2-10</a>.<span id=\"page729\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"729\" data-before-text=\"729\"></span>The united forces of Ammon, Moab, and the mountainous region of Seir came against Judah in the days of King Jehoshaphat by way of &#x201C;Hazazon-tamar, that is to say, En-gedi.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 20:2</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/1\">HAZAZON-TAMAR</a>.) In Ezekiel&#x2019;s vision of the &#x201C;healed&#x201D; seawater, fishers were prophesied to station themselves &#x201C;from En-gedi even up to En-eglaim.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001365/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 47:8-10</a>."}
