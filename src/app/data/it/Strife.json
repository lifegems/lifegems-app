One Hebrew verb rendered &#x201C;engage in strife&#x201D; is also rendered &#x201C;stir up&#x201D; and &#x201C;excite oneself.&#x201D; Among the causes for strife alluded to in the Scriptures are hatred (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 10:12</a>), rage (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 15:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 29:22</a>), intrigues (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 16:28</a>), ridicule (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 22:10</a>), heavy drinking (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 23:29,&#xA0;30</a>), slander (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 26:20</a>), arrogance or pride, and lack of right teaching (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 28:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ti 6:3,&#xA0;4</a>). Strife destroys peace and happiness. Its unpleasant and repelling effect on other persons is repeatedly highlighted in the book of Proverbs.

Some were declaring the good news out of contentiousness, probably with a view to making themselves prominent and undermining Paul&#x2019;s authority and influence. But Paul did not permit this to take away his joy in seeing that Christ was being publicized.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004247/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Php 1:15-18</a>."}
