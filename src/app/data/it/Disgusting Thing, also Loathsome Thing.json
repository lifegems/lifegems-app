Attempting to stamp out the worship of Jehovah, Antiochus built an altar over the great altar of Jehovah and sacrificed upon this a pig to the Olympian Zeus (Jupiter). An expression like that of Daniel (associating disgusting things with desolation) appears in the Apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees (1:54) as applying to this event.But this was only the Jewish interpretation of matters, not an inspired revelation. Christ Jesus showed this view to be in error when he gave the warning to his disciples: &#x201C;Therefore, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation, as spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place, (let the reader use discernment,) then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001193/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:15,&#xA0;16</a>) These words show that &#x201C;the disgusting thing that causes desolation&#x201D; was not then past but future.The pagan desecration of the temple altar by Antiochus, however disgusting in God&#x2019;s sight, did not result in desolation<wbr>&#x2014;for Jerusalem, for the temple, or for the Jewish nation.
