Although the traditional site for Argob is that of Al-Ledja, a lava-covered area about 32&#xA0;km (20&#xA0;mi) S of Damascus, the description in Deuteronomy of an area with rural towns would seem to favor the fertile plain to the W of Al-Ledja probably centered on the region between Nahr al-Ruqad, Nahr al-&#x2BD;Alan, and Nahal Yarmuk. On this broad tableland the cities had no natural defenses and would have need for the &#x2018;high walls&#x2019; mentioned in the Scriptures. There are ruins of such great cities studding the entire territory of Bashan.In King Solomon&#x2019;s time Argob was part of one of 12 districts placed under deputies responsible for providing food for the royal household.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000357/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000357/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>."}
