Shimei, the son of Gera, of a family in King Saul&#x2019;s house, harbored a grudge against David for years after Saul&#x2019;s death and the removal of the kingship from his house. Shimei found an occasion to vent his long-contained wrath when David and his party fled from Jerusalem on account of Absalom&#x2019;s rebellion. Just a little E of the Mount of Olives, Shimei walked along throwing stones and dust down at them and cursing David. Abishai asked David&#x2019;s permission to kill Shimei, but David refused, hoping that perhaps Jehovah would turn Shimei&#x2019;s curse into a blessing.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004047/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 16:5-13</a>.On David&#x2019;s return, with the situation reversed, Shimei and a thousand other Benjamites were the first to meet him, Shimei bowing before him and making expression of repentance for his sins. Again Abishai wanted to kill him, but again David did not allow it, this time swearing that he would not put Shimei to death. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004047/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 19:15-23</a>) However, before his death David told Solomon to &#x201C;bring his gray hairs down to Sheol with blood.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004047/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 2:8,&#xA0;9</a>.At the start of his reign, Solomon called Shimei and ordered him to move to Jerusalem and not to <span id=\"page931\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"931\" data-before-text=\"931\"></span>leave the city; if he ever left the city, he would be put to death. Shimei agreed to these terms, but three years later he left the city to recover two of his slaves who had fled to Gath. On learning of this violation, Solomon called Shimei to account for breaking his oath to Jehovah and ordered Benaiah to execute him.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004047/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 2:36-46</a>.<strong>13. </strong>A Levite descendant of Heman who sanctified himself and helped dispose of the unclean objects removed from the temple at the beginning of Hezekiah&#x2019;s reign.
