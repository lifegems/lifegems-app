It served as a port of call for ships from Italy, Egypt, Syria, and other places, and it was the primary harbor for cities along the Xanthus River valley.<span id=\"page585\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"585\" data-before-text=\"585\"></span>At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003399/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 21:1</a> certain ancient manuscripts add &#x201C;and Myra&#x201D; after Patara. If this addition is correct, then the ship on which Paul sailed from Miletus either passed Patara or put into port there, with the actual transfer to another boat taking place at Myra, not Patara."}
