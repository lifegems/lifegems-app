This contributed to the <span id=\"page1108\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1108\" data-before-text=\"1108\"></span>Israelites&#x2019; abandoning the true worship of Jehovah and serving false gods. Therefore, Jehovah, by means of his prophet Ahijah, indicated that ten tribes would be ripped away from the son of Solomon and that Jeroboam would rule over these.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 11:7, 8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 30-35</a>.Although Jeroboam had Jehovah&#x2019;s assurance that his kingship would be secure if he continued serving God in faithfulness, as soon as he became king he feared that the Israelites would revolt if they continued going up to Jerusalem for worship. For this reason he instituted calf worship at Dan and Bethel and there built high places.

The &#x201C;high places of Isaac&#x201D; evidently refer to the sacred high places where the Israelites of the ten-tribe kingdom, descendants of Isaac through Jacob, or Israel, practiced apostate worship. This is also indicated by the fact that the expression &#x201C;high places of Isaac&#x201D; runs parallel with &#x2018;sanctuaries of Israel.&#x2019;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Am 7:9</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 10:2-10</a>.After the king of Assyria took the ten-tribe kingdom into exile, the high places continued to exist for a time, since the foreign peoples who were moved into the territory of Samaria by the king of Assyria continued employing the high places in their worship.

It may be that, although Asa removed the high places for worship of false gods, he left those at which the people worshiped Jehovah. Or, perhaps, high places cropped up again toward the end of his reign and were thereby present for his successor Jehoshaphat to destroy. But even during Jehoshaphat&#x2019;s <span id=\"page1109\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1109\" data-before-text=\"1109\"></span>reign the high places did not fully disappear.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 33:10-17</a>) Manasseh&#x2019;s successor, his son Amon, did not continue the reforms started by his father but made guiltiness increase.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 33:21-24</a>.Josiah, who succeeded Amon, distinguished himself by doing what was right in Jehovah&#x2019;s eyes and adhering to the law of Moses. He put out of business the foreign-god priests, who rendered up sacrificial smoke on the high places. He pulled down the high places not only throughout Judah but also in the cities of Samaria. The sites used for false worship were desecrated so that they could not be used to offend Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 23:4-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/47/1\" data-bid=\"48-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 34:1-7</a>.The account of Josiah&#x2019;s making the high places that had been built by Solomon unfit for worship tends to confirm the conclusion that, although previous kings had torn down the high places, there was a revival of these. It seems only logical that faithful Kings Asa and Jehoshaphat had torn down these high places of false worship that dated from the reign of Solomon.Although no further mention is made of high places in the Kings and Chronicles accounts after Josiah&#x2019;s thorough purge of all vestiges of false worship, the last four kings of Judah, namely, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, are reported as doing what was bad in Jehovah&#x2019;s eyes. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 23:31, 32,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/48/1\" data-bid=\"49-2\" class=\"b\"> 36, 37;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/48/2\" data-bid=\"49-3\" class=\"b\"> 24:8, 9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/48/3\" data-bid=\"49-4\" class=\"b\"> 18,&#xA0;19</a>) Apostate worship at high places was resumed by the Israelites. Hence, Jehovah, through his prophet Ezekiel, warned the nation of the dire consequences to come upon them: &#x201C;I am bringing upon you a sword, and I shall certainly destroy your high places. And your altars must be made desolate and your incense stands must be broken, and I will cause your slain ones to fall before your dungy idols.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 6:3,&#xA0;4</a>.It is noteworthy that there is no record of any worship at high places after the return from Babylonian exile. As had been foretold, the faithful Jewish remnant had profited from the bitter experience and had come to know Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002022/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 6:9,&#xA0;10</a>.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;1108]</strong>High place at Gezer.
