{"title":"Flea","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200001532","html":"<span id=\"page840\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"840\" data-before-text=\"840\"></span><strong>FLEA</strong>[Heb., <em>par&#xB7;&#x2BD;osh&#x2B9;</em>].A very small wingless parasitic insect. Fleas are usually reddish brown and have short front and middle legs but long hind legs. The flea&#x2019;s strong and spiny legs as well as its flat sides enable it to move with ease and rapidity between the hairs or feathers of its host. The short rearward-pointing hairs covering this insect&#x2019;s oval-shaped body not only permit the flea to move forward readily but also make it more difficult for the victim to remove it. The flea&#x2019;s small head is equipped with a beak that is used to pierce the skin of its victim, causing the blood to flow. Its leaping ability is phenomenal. Although less than 0.3&#xA0;cm (1&#x2044;8&#xA0;in.) long, the flea that lives on humans can jump more than 30&#xA0;cm (1&#xA0;ft) horizontally and nearly 20&#xA0;cm (8&#xA0;in.) vertically. The Biblical variety of flea is probably that called <em>Pulex irritans.</em>In Scripture the flea is mentioned only twice. When David was being pursued by King Saul, he questioned the king: &#x201C;After whom are you chasing? .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. After a single flea?&#x201D; By comparing himself to a flea, David emphasized his littleness in comparison with Saul, thus showing that it was hardly worth while for the king to chase after him.
