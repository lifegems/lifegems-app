Though, at times, in various translations the word &#x201C;mind&#x201D; is used, in the same instances other translations employ the above descriptive and specific terms. In the Hebrew text, the words for &#x201C;remember&#x201D; and &#x201C;consider&#x201D; may be translated in certain places by such expressions as &#x201C;keep in mind&#x201D; and &#x201C;have in mind.&#x201D; In the Hebrew Scriptures, &#x201C;mind&#x201D; appears in some versions as a rendering of the Hebrew words that are, literally and properly, &#x201C;heart,&#x201D; &#x201C;soul,&#x201D; and &#x201C;spirit.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 4:39</a>, ftn; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 9:15</a>, <em>Ro; </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 20:32</a>, <em>JB; </em>see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/0\">HEART</a>.<strong>&#x201C;New in the Force Actuating Your Mind.&#x201D; </strong>The inclination of the mind of imperfect man is naturally toward wrong thinking. The Bible terms it the &#x201C;fleshly frame of mind.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Col 2:18</a>) Christians are reminded that formerly they were enemies of God because their minds had been on the works that were wicked.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Col 1:21</a>.The mind of the &#x201C;physical&#x201D; (literally, &#x201C;soulical&#x201D;) man, as distinguished from the &#x201C;spiritual&#x201D; man, is inclined in the direction of materialistic things. The force that actuates his mind has been formed in him in part by inheritance and in part by the things he has been taught and has experienced. When a matter is presented to him, this force pushes or inclines his mind in a materialistic or fleshly direction. Christians are commanded, therefore, to &#x201C;be made new in the force [spirit] actuating your mind.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 4:23</a>) By a study of God&#x2019;s Word of truth and by the operation of God&#x2019;s spirit, this actuating force can be changed so that the person&#x2019;s dominant mental attitude is inclined in a right direction. Then, when a matter is presented to the person, the mind will be inclined by this force toward a proper spiritual course.

But &#x201C;sin&#x2019;s law&#x201D; operating in fallen flesh fights against the &#x2018;law of the mind,&#x2019; so that there is a constant conflict within the Christian. Can he be victorious? Yes, &#x201C;thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!&#x201D; God&#x2019;s undeserved kindness provides, on the basis of Christ&#x2019;s ransom sacrifice, forgiveness for the sins of the flesh and, additionally, the help of holy spirit. The Christian is in a situation different from that of the non-Christian, as Paul sums it up: &#x201C;So, then, with <span id=\"page405\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"405\" data-before-text=\"405\"></span>my mind I myself am a slave to God&#x2019;s law, but with my flesh to sin&#x2019;s law.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 7:21-25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> Ga 5:16,&#xA0;17</a>.How does the mind win out in the battle? The apostle illuminates the matter further, saying: &#x201C;Those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those in accord with the spirit on the things of the spirit. For the minding of the flesh means death, but the minding of the spirit means life and peace; because the minding of the flesh means enmity with God, for it [fallen, imperfect flesh] is not under subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. If, now, the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his spirit that resides in you.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:5-11</a>.<strong>The &#x201C;Meaning&#x201D; of the Spirit. </strong>At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 8:26, 27</a>, Paul shows that, when God&#x2019;s servants are praying, they may not always know exactly what they should pray for as they need to. But God knows that they desire his will to be done. He also knows what his servants need. God has in the past caused many inspired prayers to be recorded in his Word, expressing his will or mind for them. He therefore accepts these inspired prayers as being what his people should like to ask and pray for, and accordingly, he fulfills them. God knows the righthearted ones and also knows the meaning of the things that he caused his spirit to speak through the Bible writers. He knows what the &#x201C;meaning [mind, thought] of the spirit is&#x201D; when the spirit thus &#x201C;pleads,&#x201D; or intercedes, for them.<strong>Loving With the Mind. </strong>Jehovah foretold the making of a new covenant under which the holy spirit would work to write his laws in the minds and hearts of his people. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 8:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:16</a>) In this way they are able to fulfill that upon which the whole Law and the Prophets hung, namely, to &#x2018;love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 22:37-40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 10:27,&#xA0;28</a>) A person must love God with his whole heart (the desires, feelings, and emotions of the inner personality), his whole soul (his life and entire being), and his <em>whole mind </em>(his intellectual faculties). This latter phrase means that not only must God&#x2019;s servants love with feelings, emotions, and strength but they must also apply their minds vigorously in order to take in knowledge of God and Christ (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 17:3</a>), to understand (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 12:33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> Eph 3:18</a>), to serve God and his purposes, and to share in declaring the good news.

He said that if he were to pray in a tongue that he could not translate, his mind would be unfruitful. Again, if he were to sing praises in the same manner, how would it help the hearer who did not understand the tongue? Consequently, he said that he would rather speak five words with his mind, in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue. He then urged his brothers to become full grown in powers of understanding.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 14:13-20</a>.Jehovah&#x2019;s servants are commanded to be &#x201C;fitly united in the <em>same mind </em>and in the <em>same line of thought.&#x201D; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 1:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> Php 2:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003065/24/2\" data-bid=\"25-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 3:8</a>) This means, of course, being united where the interests of pure worship are involved<wbr>&#x2014;the important things&#x2014;<wbr>not in individual tastes or in minor matters that will be resolved as maturity is reached.
