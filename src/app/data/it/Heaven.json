There is a definite appropriateness in this meaning, inasmuch as clouds form when warm air, rising from the earth, becomes cooled to what is known as the dewpoint, and the water vapor in it condenses into minute particles sometimes called water dust. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Job 36:27, 28</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/2\">CLOUD</a>.) Adding to the appropriateness, the visual effect of the blue dome of the sky is caused by the diffusion of the rays of the sun by gas molecules and other particles (including dust) composing the atmosphere. By God&#x2019;s formation of such atmosphere, he has, in effect, &#x2018;beaten out the skies hard like a molten mirror,&#x2019; giving a definite limit, or clear demarcation, to the atmospheric blue vault above man.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Job 37:18</a>.<strong><em>&#x201C;Heavens of the heavens.&#x201D; </em></strong>The expression &#x201C;heavens of the heavens&#x201D; is considered to refer to the highest heavens and would embrace the complete extent of the physical heavens, however vast, since the heavens extend out from the earth in all directions.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">De 10:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/29/1\" data-bid=\"30-2\" class=\"b\"> Ne 9:6</a>.Solomon, the constructor of the temple at Jerusalem, stated that the &#x201C;heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens&#x201D; cannot contain God.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 40:12</a>) Solomon&#x2019;s statement does not mean that God has no specific place of residence. Nor does it mean that he is omnipresent in the sense of being literally everywhere and in everything. This can be seen from the fact that Solomon also spoke of Jehovah as hearing &#x201C;from the heavens, your established place of dwelling,&#x201D; that is, the heavens of the spirit realm.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 8:30,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;39</a>.Thus, in the physical sense, the term &#x201C;heavens&#x201D; covers a wide range. While it may refer to the farthest reaches of universal space, it may also refer to something that is simply high, or lofty, to a degree beyond the ordinary. Thus, those aboard storm-tossed ships are said to &#x201C;go up to the heavens, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. down to the bottoms.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 107:26</a>) So, too, the builders of the Tower of Babel intended to put up a structure with its &#x201C;top in the heavens,&#x201D; a &#x201C;skyscraper,&#x201D; as it were.

As has been seen, Jehovah God does not reside in the physical heavens, being a Spirit.

Upon the Israelites&#x2019; return to their homeland, they entered into a new system of things. Cyrus the Great was used prominently by God in bringing about that restoration.

Whereas some have endeavored to relate Paul&#x2019;s reference to the third heaven to the early rabbinic view that there were stages of heaven, even a total of &#x201C;seven heavens,&#x201D; this view finds no support in the Scriptures. As we have seen, the heavens are not referred to specifically as if divided into platforms or stages, but, rather, the context must be relied upon to determine whether reference is to the heavens within earth&#x2019;s atmospheric expanse, the heavens of outer space, the spiritual heavens, or something else. It therefore appears that the reference to &#x201C;the third heaven&#x201D; likely indicates the superlative form of rulership of the Messianic Kingdom.

For that reason these things are viewed as personified, hence, as if able to make a request, or petition. <span id=\"page1064\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1064\" data-before-text=\"1064\"></span>Israel asks for grain, wine, and oil; these products, in turn, seek their plant food and water from the earth; the earth, in order to supply this need, requires (or figuratively calls for) sun, rain, and dew from the heavens; and the heavens (till now &#x201C;shut up&#x201D; because of the withdrawal of God&#x2019;s blessing) can respond only if God accepts the petition and restores his favor to the nation, thereby putting the productive cycle in motion.

This expresses the delicate finery of such heavenly canopy. On a clear night the thousands of stars do, indeed, form a lacy web stretched over the black velvet background of space. It may also be noted that even the enormous galaxy known as the Via Lactea, or Milky Way, in which our solar system is located, has a filmy gauzelike appearance from earth&#x2019;s viewpoint.It can be seen from the foregoing that the context must always be considered in determining the sense of these figurative expressions. Thus, when Moses called on &#x201C;the heavens and the earth&#x201D; to serve as witnesses to the things that he declared to Israel, it is obvious that he did not mean the inanimate creation but, rather, the intelligent residents inhabiting the heavens and the earth.
