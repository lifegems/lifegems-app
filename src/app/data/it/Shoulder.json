It supplied many courageous fighters for Judge Barak and, later, provided Judge Tola; also, in the time of David, this tribe furnished many wise and valiant men.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 5:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 10:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 7:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/4/4\" data-bid=\"5-5\" class=\"b\"> 12:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/4/5\" data-bid=\"5-6\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;32</a>.An authority or responsibility was said to rest on one&#x2019;s shoulder. Isaiah&#x2019;s prophecy foretold that the princely rule would come to be on the shoulder of Jesus Christ. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 9:6</a>) Isaiah told unfaithful Shebna that Eliakim would take his place as steward over the king&#x2019;s house, God putting &#x201C;the key of the house of David&#x201D; upon his shoulder. Since a key in such cases represented responsibility and authority, this prophecy may relate to Christ&#x2019;s receiving the authority of the Kingdom as represented in the Davidic covenant.

It is interesting to note also that the breastpiece of judgment <span id=\"page936\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"936\" data-before-text=\"936\"></span>hung from the shoulder pieces of the high priest&#x2019;s garments, evidently picturing certain authorities that would depend on or rest upon the shoulders of the great High Priest, Jesus Christ.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 28:6, 7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> 22-28</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/0\">HIGH PRIEST</a>.After blessing Joseph&#x2019;s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, Jacob said to Joseph: &#x201C;I do give you one shoulder [of land] more than to your brothers,&#x201D; thereby designating Joseph as the possessor of firstborn rights.

Moses said of Benjamin, when he blessed the sons of Israel: &#x201C;Let the beloved one of Jehovah reside in security by him, .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. and he must reside between his shoulders.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004083/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">De 33:12</a>) This seems to refer to the fact that the kings of the line of David would have their seat of government in Benjamin&#x2019;s territory.
