(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000318/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 19:12</a>) It seems to have been tied around the waist to cover part of the body for a distance below the waist. It may have been worn to protect other garments, perhaps by tradesmen such as fishermen, potters, water carriers, grocers, bakers, and carpenters. The ephod of the priests was considerably different, being an apronlike garment that hung from the shoulders, having front and back sections.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000318/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 28:6-8</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000318/0\">HIGH PRIEST</a>.The Greek word translated &#x201C;put on an apron&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000318/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 17:8</a> (<em>pe&#xB7;ri&#xB7;zon&#x2B9;ny&#xB7;mai</em>) literally means &#x201C;gird oneself about.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000318/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 6:14</a>."}
