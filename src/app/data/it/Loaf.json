An Egyptian papyrus document mentions over 30 different forms of bread.Ancient specimens from Bible lands include relatively thin round, oval, triangular, and wedge-shaped cakes or loaves and thick, long loaves. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/0\">BREAD</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/1\">CAKE</a>.) However, the thick loaves, like those of the Western world, do not appear to have been common in the ancient Middle East. Even today Oriental bread is baked in thin loaves, usually from 1 to 2.5&#xA0;cm (0.5 to 1&#xA0;in.) in thickness and about 18&#xA0;cm (7&#xA0;in.) in diameter.Since they were relatively thin and, if unleavened, brittle, loaves of bread were broken rather than cut. So in itself there is nothing special about Jesus&#x2019; &#x2018;breaking&#x2019; the loaf used at the institution of the Lord&#x2019;s Evening Meal (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:26</a>), it being the customary way to partake of bread.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 14:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> Mr 6:41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\"> 8:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/7/4\" data-bid=\"8-5\" class=\"b\"> Lu 9:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/7/5\" data-bid=\"8-6\" class=\"b\"> Ac 2:42,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002757/7/6\" data-bid=\"8-7\" class=\"b\"> 46</a>, <em>Int.</em>"}
