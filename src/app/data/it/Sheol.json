In the <em>King James Version, </em>it is translated 31 times as &#x201C;hell,&#x201D; 31 times as &#x201C;grave,&#x201D; and 3 times as &#x201C;pit.&#x201D; The Catholic <em>Douay Version </em>rendered the word 63 times as &#x201C;hell,&#x201D; once as &#x201C;pit,&#x201D; and once as &#x201C;death.&#x201D; In addition, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004011/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 7:11</a> the Hebrew text originally read <em>she&#x2BC;ohl&#x2B9;, </em>and it was rendered as &#x201C;Hades&#x201D; in the ancient Greek versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and as &#x201C;hell&#x201D; in the <em>Douay Version.<wbr></em>&#x2014;See <em>NW </em>ftn.There is no English word that conveys the precise sense of the Hebrew word <em>she&#x2BC;ohl&#x2B9;. </em>Commenting on the use of the word &#x201C;hell&#x201D; in Bible translation, <em>Collier&#x2019;s Encyclopedia </em>(1986, Vol.&#xA0;12, p.&#xA0;28) says: &#x201C;Since Sheol in Old Testament times referred simply to the abode of the dead and suggested no moral distinctions, the word &#x2018;hell,&#x2019; as understood today, is not a happy translation.&#x201D; More recent versions transliterate the word into English as &#x201C;Sheol.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>RS, AT, NW.</em>Regarding Sheol, the <em>Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica </em>(1971, Vol.&#xA0;11, p.&#xA0;276) noted: &#x201C;Sheol was located somewhere &#x2018;under&#x2019; the earth. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The state of the dead was one of neither pain nor pleasure. Neither reward for the righteous nor punishment for the wicked was associated with Sheol. The good and the bad alike, tyrants and saints, kings and orphans, Israelites and gentiles<wbr>&#x2014;all slept together without awareness of one another.&#x201D;While the Greek teaching of the immortality of the human soul infiltrated Jewish religious thinking in later centuries, the Bible record shows that Sheol refers to mankind&#x2019;s common grave as a place where there is no consciousness.

Luke, in quoting Peter&#x2019;s words, used the Greek word <em>hai&#x2B9;des, </em>thereby showing that Sheol and Hades refer to the same thing, mankind&#x2019;s common grave.

Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help.

It is represented as a dark place, in which there is no activity worthy of the name. There are no moral distinctions there, so &#x2018;hell&#x2019; (KJV) is not a suitable translation, since that suggests a contrast with &#x2018;heaven&#x2019; as the dwelling-place of the righteous after death. In a sense, &#x2018;the grave&#x2019; in a generic sense is a near equivalent, except that Sheol is more a mass grave in which all the dead dwell together. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.
