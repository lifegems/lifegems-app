The basic idea of &#x201C;ransom&#x201D; is a price that <em>covers </em>(as in payment for damages or to satisfy justice), while &#x201C;redemption&#x201D; emphasizes the <em>releasing </em>accomplished as a result of the ransom paid. The most significant ransom price is the shed blood of Jesus Christ, which made deliverance from sin and death possible for the offspring of Adam.In the various Hebrew and Greek terms translated &#x201C;ransom&#x201D; and &#x201C;redeem,&#x201D; the inherent similarity lies in the idea of a price, or thing of value, given to effect the ransom, or redemption. The thought of exchange, as well as that of correspondency, equivalence, or substitution, is common in all. That is, one thing is given for another, satisfying the demands of justice and resulting in a balancing of matters.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003640/0\">RECONCILIATION</a>.<strong>A Price That Covers. </strong>The Hebrew noun <em>ko&#x2B9;pher </em>comes from the verb <em>ka&#xB7;phar&#x2B9;, </em>meaning, basically, &#x201C;cover,&#x201D; as in Noah&#x2019;s covering the ark with tar.

However, since he did not deliberately or directly kill another, if the judges viewed it proper to impose upon him a &#x201C;ransom [<em>ko&#x2B9;pher</em>]&#x201D; instead, then he must pay that redemption price.

In redeeming Israel from Egypt, Jehovah evidently caused the price to be paid by Egypt.

Mankind&#x2019;s need for a ransom came about through the rebellion in Eden. Adam sold himself to do evil for the selfish pleasure of keeping continued company with his wife, now a sinful transgressor, so he shared the same condemned standing with her before God. He thereby sold himself and his descendants into slavery to sin and to death, the price that God&#x2019;s justice required. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003640/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:12-19</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003640/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 7:14-25</a>.) Having possessed human perfection, Adam lost this valuable possession for himself and all his offspring.The Law, which had &#x201C;a shadow of the good things to come,&#x201D; provided for animal sacrifices as a covering for sin. This, however, was only a symbolic or token covering, since such animals were inferior to man; hence, it was &#x201C;not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats [actually] to take sins away,&#x201D; as the apostle points out. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003640/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:1-4</a>) Those pictorial animal sacrifices had to be without blemish, perfect specimens. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003640/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Le 22:21</a>) The real ransom sacrifice, a human actually capable of removing sins, must therefore also be perfect, free from blemish. He would have to correspond to the perfect Adam and possess human perfection, if he were to pay the price of redemption that would release Adam&#x2019;s offspring from the debt, disability, and enslavement into which their first father Adam had sold them.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003640/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 49:6-9</a>) However, this results in the magnifying of God&#x2019;s own love and mercy in that he met his own requirements at tremendous cost to himself, giving the life of his own Son to provide the redemption price. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003640/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:6-8</a>) This required his Son&#x2019;s becoming human to correspond to the perfect Adam.

They describe, not an ordinary purchase or releasing, but a redeeming or ransoming, a deliverance effected by payment of a corresponding price.Though available to all, Christ&#x2019;s ransom sacrifice is not accepted by all, and &#x201C;the wrath of God remains&#x201D; upon those not accepting it, as it also comes upon those who first accept and then turn away from that provision.
