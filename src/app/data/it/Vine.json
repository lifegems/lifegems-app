Sometimes the vines were systematically planted in rows 2.5&#xA0;m (8&#xA0;ft) or more apart in well-prepared soil. No other seeds were to be planted in a vineyard, according to the Mosaic Law, though trees, such as the fig, might be planted there.

Jesus said that &#x201C;every branch .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans [by pruning], that it may bear more fruit.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004557/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 15:2</a>) The pruning of productive branches and the cutting off of fruitless ones allow the plant to use its full strength in producing fruit of higher quality.

For example, it is reported that one such vine in Jericho was over 300 years old and had a trunk diameter of nearly 46&#xA0;cm (18&#xA0;in.). Sometimes these old vines reached a height of more than 9&#xA0;m (30&#xA0;ft) and were veritable &#x2018;vine trees.&#x2019; But in spite of such stature among the trees of the forest, such vine wood is not serviceable either as &#x201C;a pole with which to do some work&#x201D; or &#x201C;a peg on which to hang any kind of utensil,&#x201D; for it is too soft; and it is not straight enough for lumber.
