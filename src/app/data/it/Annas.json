(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000284/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:2</a>) Annas was therefore high priest when Jesus, at the age of 12, amazed the rabbinic teachers at the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000284/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:42-49</a>) Annas was removed as high priest by Procurator Valerius Gratus. Though he no longer had the official title, it was quite evident that he continued to exercise great power and influence as high priest emeritus and predominant voice of the Jewish hierarchy. Five of his sons, as well as his son-in-law Caiaphas, each held the office of high priest. Because of his prominent position, Annas is rightly designated in the Scriptures as one of the chief priests.
