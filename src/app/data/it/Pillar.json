The Israelites, upon entering the Promised Land, were to destroy such sacred pillars, and they were forbidden to set up pillars of that sort.

Such pillars were neither objects of idolatrous worship nor symbolic of sex organs. They served to recall historic acts or events.On two occasions Jacob set up stone pillars at Bethel. Both instances involved taking note of Jehovah&#x2019;s dealing with Jacob in a special way at that place.

These were to serve as a memorial to Israel and would give occasion for fathers to explain to their sons what the twelve stones meant.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 4:1-9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 20-24</a>.A covenant or a victory could be marked by setting up a stone, often a pillar.

Written in the eighth century B.C.E., it dealt with circumstances after the destruction of Jerusalem in 607&#xA0;B.C.E. Some of the Jews who were left in their land by the Babylonians fled to Egypt and dwelt in Egyptian cities, as foretold in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 19:18</a>.

Often the roof beams or upper stories of a building were held up by vertical columns. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 9:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 16:25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/14/2\" data-bid=\"15-3\" class=\"b\"> 29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/14/3\" data-bid=\"15-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 7:2</a>) The wood or brick pillars might rest on stone bases. Solomon&#x2019;s House of the Forest of Lebanon contained rows of cedarwood pillars supporting the beams and upper chambers. Apparently the fact that the cedar was from Lebanon or the resemblance of the pillars to a forest resulted in the building&#x2019;s name. The nearby Porch of Pillars was obviously also noted for its abundant pillars, though the record does not give their number or material. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 7:1-6</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 40:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> 48,&#xA0;49</a>.)

The <em>New Bible Dictionary </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Douglas (1985, p.&#xA0;941) suggests that the king stood by one of these pillars on ceremonial occasions, but that cannot be confirmed, for the Bible merely says the king was &#x201C;standing by his pillar at the entry.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 23:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 11:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> 23:3</a>) He could have been standing at a gate of the inner court or some other elevated place for addressing the people.Smaller pillars were used in the tabernacle, four of acacia wood to support the curtain between the Holy and Most Holy and five to hold up the screen at the entrance.

They would illustrate that which securely upholds. The Christian congregation could be called &#x201C;a pillar and support of the truth,&#x201D; for it upholds the truth in contrast to religious error. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003489/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 3:15</a>) James, Cephas, and John were spoken of as &#x2018;seeming to be pillars&#x2019; in the early congregation; they were solidly fixed and strong supporters of it.
