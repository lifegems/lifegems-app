In Bible times this milk product was unlike that of the modern Western world, for instead of being solid it was in a semifluid state. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000845/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 20:17</a>) Hence, Koehler and Baumgartner define the Hebrew word <em>chem&#xB7;&#x2BC;ah&#x2B9; </em>as sweet, fresh butter, still soft. (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;308) Franciscus Zorell says that this word refers to &#x201C;thick, curdled milk.&#x201D; (<em>Lexicon Hebraicum et Aramaicum Veteris Testamenti, </em>Rome, 1968, p.&#xA0;248) The same word is rendered &#x201C;curdled milk&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000845/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Judges 5:25</a>.&#x201C;The churning [literally, squeezing] of milk is what brings forth butter.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000845/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 30:33</a>) This was done by putting the milk in a skin bottle and kneading it, rocking it upon the knees, or suspending it between poles and swinging it back and forth abruptly until the desired consistency was reached.Butter, though considered a delicacy, has been eaten and enjoyed since patriarchal times. Abraham included it in the feast he spread for the angelic visitors (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000845/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 18:8</a>); David&#x2019;s friends came to him with butter and other gifts of sustenance.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000845/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 17:29</a>.&#x201C;Butter&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000845/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 55:21</a> is used figuratively to refer to the pleasant, smooth, oily words of a traitor."}
