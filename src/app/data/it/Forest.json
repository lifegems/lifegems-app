The Scriptural references to forests and woodlands and to the use of wood materials make it evident that trees were then much more common there than at present, despite the reforestation efforts in recent years.

Denis Baly, in his book <em>The Geography of the Bible </em>(1974, pp.&#xA0;77, 115, 116), speaks of centuries of neglect, which has resulted in the disappearance of many woodlands and the loss of as much as 2&#xA0;m (6.5 ft) of fertile soil, leaving much of the land rocky and barren.Certain forests are specifically mentioned in the Bible. The forests of Lebanon, now reduced to a few small groves, were outstanding for their splendid tree growth (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001552/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 5:2-10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001552/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 13-18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001552/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 19:23</a>), with great quantities of cedar, juniper, cypress, and other trees. The &#x201C;forest of Ephraim&#x201D; (perhaps &#x201C;forest of Mahanaim&#x201D;), in which Absalom met disaster, may have been located E of the Jordan River near Mahanaim, and appears to have been of considerable density.
