It consists of four messages from Jehovah to Jews that had returned from Babylonian exile, urging them to finish rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem. Also being prophetic, the book foretold such things as the filling of Jehovah&#x2019;s house with glory and the overthrow of human kingdoms.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Hag 2:6, 7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 21,&#xA0;22</a>.<strong>Writership and Canonicity. </strong>The writer was Haggai the prophet, who personally delivered each message found in the book. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Hag 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> 20</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/0\">HAGGAI</a>.) While most of the ancient Scripture catalogs do not list the book of Haggai by name, it is evidently included in their references to the &#x2018;twelve Minor Prophets,&#x2019; the number 12 thus being complete. The Jews have never questioned its right to a place among the Hebrew <span id=\"page1019\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1019\" data-before-text=\"1019\"></span>Scriptures, and the canonicity of the book is definitely established by the quotation from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Haggai 2:6</a> appearing at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 12:26</a>.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Hag 2:21</a>.<strong>Style. </strong>The language is simple and the meaning is made abundantly clear. Thought-provoking questions are sometimes posed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Hag 1:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 2:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/5/3\" data-bid=\"6-4\" class=\"b\"> 12, 13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/5/4\" data-bid=\"6-5\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;19</a>) The book of Haggai contains strong reproof, encouragement, and hope-inspiring prophecy. The divine name, Jehovah, appears 35 times in its 38 verses, and it is clearly shown that the messages were from God, Haggai serving as His commissioned messenger.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1:13</a>.<strong>Date and Circumstances. </strong>The four messages recorded by Haggai were delivered at Jerusalem within about a four-month period in the second year of Persian King Darius Hystaspis (520&#xA0;B.C.E.), the book apparently being completed in 520&#xA0;B.C.E.

It shows that God is with his people (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Hag 1:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001813/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:4,&#xA0;5</a>), and it also urges them to put his interests first in life.
