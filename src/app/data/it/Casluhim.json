The Biblical record shows that it was the Casluhim &#x201C;from among whom the Philistines went forth.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000902/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000902/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000902/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 1:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000902/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 11,&#xA0;12</a>) Since other texts speak of the Philistines as coming from Caphtor or Crete (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000902/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 47:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000902/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Am 9:7</a>), some scholars suggest that the above phrase should be transposed to come after the last-named descendant of Mizraim, Caphtorim. However, there is no need to assume a contradiction in these texts. The record at Genesis (paralleled by that in Chronicles) is genealogical. The other references to the Philistines as proceeding from Caphtor are likely geographic, indicating a migration from the territory of the Caphtorim.The Casluhim do not appear elsewhere in the Bible and have left no definite mark in secular history. Aside from their descending from Mizraim, whose name was equivalent to Egypt in Bible times, there is no information to show where they settled."}
