The Roman legion, regardless of its size, was always divided into 60 centuries, each under the command of a centurion. If the legion shrank below 6,000, still one sixtieth, even when less than 100, was under a centurion. These army officers were nominated by tribunes and were approved by higher government authorities. The office of centurion was the highest rank the common soldier could reach, though there were opportunities for some advancement within the ranks of the centurions themselves.The centurions were keymen and served a most important function in the legion. While they were under the authority of the tribunes and responsible to carry out their orders, the army officer was the real and immediate head of the soldiers. He drilled the soldiers; worked with them; inspected their arms, supplies, and food; regulated their conduct. He was the disciplinarian who supervised scourgings and capital punishment, the one who authorized punishment of his troops. The readiness and efficiency of the Roman army, for the most part, depended more on centurions than on anyone else; they were, generally speaking, the most experienced and valuable men in the Roman army.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000377/0\">ARMY</a>.Army officers appear in the Christian Greek Scripture narratives on several occasions. The army officer from Capernaum who sought Jesus&#x2019; healing power on behalf of his slave was commended by the Master for his exemplary faith.

If he was a Roman, this was all the more remarkable, for Romans were not noted for their compassion toward slaves.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000377/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 7:1-9</a>.An army officer headed the four soldiers who put Jesus to death.

In turn, two army officers were ordered to ready a force of 470 soldiers, cavalry, and spearmen to ensure Paul&#x2019;s safe conduct out of Jerusalem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000377/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 23:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000377/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>.Julius, an army officer of the band of Augustus (see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000377/2\">AUGUSTUS, BAND OF</a>), was responsible for Paul&#x2019;s passage from Caesarea to Rome.
