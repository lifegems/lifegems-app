In the view of some scholars, the Cherethites also functioned as a special bodyguard for these kings. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000890/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 8:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000890/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 1:38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000890/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 18:17</a>) This connection of the Carian bodyguard with the Cherethites is additionally based on the fact that the Masoretic text says &#x201C;Carian bodyguard&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000890/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Samuel 20:23</a>, while the reading in its margin, as well as in many Hebrew manuscripts, is &#x201C;Cherethites.&#x201D;There is an ancient district of Caria in the SW part of Asia Minor. Because <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000890/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 25:16</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000890/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Zephaniah 2:5</a> associate the Cherethites with the Philistines, and because the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>rendering of these texts has &#x201C;Cretans&#x201D; instead of Cherethites, some believe that perhaps those in the Carian bodyguard had originally come from the district of Caria by way of Crete."}
