In the Bible, man&#x2019;s pronouncement of a blessing often amounts to an appeal for divine blessing, even though not necessarily expressed in a prayer. So while man may be the intended object of such a blessing, the Source is admittedly God himself. Again, man&#x2019;s blessing of other men may often constitute an expression of gratitude, an appreciative acknowledgment of fine qualities or of a job well done.It is with reference to being able to bless with effectiveness, to have the authority from God to bless or the power to carry out the blessing, that Paul, in arguing the superiority of Melchizedek&#x2019;s priesthood over that of Levi, expresses the principle: &#x201C;Now without any dispute, the less is blessed by the greater.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000772/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:7</a>) Melchizedek was a priest of God and a king and could speak for God authoritatively and prophetically in giving Abraham a blessing.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000772/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:18-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000772/39/1\" data-bid=\"40-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 7:1-4</a>.When individuals have done something that contributes to Jehovah&#x2019;s praise, others have seen fit to pronounce a blessing on them.

Saying or asking a blessing upon food before a meal is usually done in prayer. In such prayer thanks and praise are given to Jehovah for his spiritual and material provisions, asking that Jehovah will direct the nourishment to be used for the benefit of those partaking and that the food will strengthen them to serve him.
