Written by Obadiah (concerning whom nothing but the name is known), this book contains a proclamation of Jehovah&#x2019;s judgment against Edom, presents the reason for that judgment, and points forward to restoration for &#x201C;the house of Jacob.&#x201D; The extinction of the Edomites as a people and the restoration of the Israelites to their land confirm the accurate fulfillment of Obadiah&#x2019;s prophecy.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003288/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ob 17, 18</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003288/0\">EDOM, EDOMITES</a>.The occasion for the prophecy was the &#x2018;unbrotherly&#x2019; treatment that the Edomites rendered to &#x201C;the sons of Judah&#x201D; when the latter suffered defeat. The Edomites, through their ancestor Esau, were related to the Israelites. The Edomites rejoiced over Judah&#x2019;s calamity, shared in taking spoil from the Jews, prevented them from escaping out of the land, and even handed them over to the enemy.
