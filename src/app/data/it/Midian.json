(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 37:25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 27, 28,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> 36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> 39:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/3/4\" data-bid=\"4-5\" class=\"b\"> Jg 8:22,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/3/5\" data-bid=\"4-6\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;24</a>.) This may imply that the descendants of Abraham through his sons Ishmael and Midian were much alike in their way of life, and there may have been a further amalgamation through intermarriage among the two peoples. It also appears that at least some of the Kenites were known as Midianites. Since the Kenites are already mentioned as a people before Midian&#x2019;s birth, this may mean that Moses&#x2019; Kenite brother-in-law Hobab was a Midianite merely from a geographic standpoint.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 15:18, 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Nu 10:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> 4:11</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/0\">ISHMAELITE</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/1\">KENITE</a>.Being descendants of Abraham, the Midianites likely spoke a language that closely resembled Hebrew. Gideon, for instance, apparently had no difficulty in understanding the Midianites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 7:13-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 8:18,&#xA0;19</a>) There is also a possibility, however, that Gideon learned the tongue of the Midianites, Israel having been under their domination for seven years.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 6:1</a>.The Midianites were primarily nomadic tent dwellers.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 31:9,&#xA0;10</a>) At that time they were quite prosperous, having asses and animals of the flock and the herd numbering into the tens of thousands.

Midianite kings were arrayed in &#x201C;garments of wool dyed reddish purple,&#x201D; and even their camels had necklaces, evidently with moon-shaped ornaments attached.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 31:50;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 8:21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/11/2\" data-bid=\"12-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;26</a>.Doubtless the Midianites acquired much of their wealth through trade and plunder.

As early as the time of Joseph, caravans of Midianite merchants traveled to Egypt. It was to such a caravan bound for Egypt and carrying aromatic resins that Joseph was sold by his half brothers.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 37:25,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;28</a>.Probably sometime before Israel&#x2019;s entry into the Promised Land, Edomite King Hadad (son of Bedad) gained the victory over the Midianites in the field of Moab.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 36:35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 1:46</a>.<strong>Cause Israel to Sin. </strong>Later, the Midianites manifested hostility toward the Israelites.

The Midianite cities and walled camps in the area were consigned to the fire. Thousands of domestic animals and many gold articles were taken as spoils. With the exception of the virgins, all, including the five kings of Midian<wbr>&#x2014;Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba&#x2014;<wbr>were put to death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Nu&#xA0;31</a>.Less than three centuries later, the Midianites had recovered from this blow sufficiently to be able to oppress the Israelites for seven years.

Along with the Amalekites and &#x201C;Easterners,&#x201D; these tent-dwelling nomads, with their livestock and innumerable camels, penetrated Israel&#x2019;s land all the way to Gaza, plundering the domestic animals of the Israelites and also consuming their harvests.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 6:2-6</a>.<strong>Crushing Defeat by Gideon. </strong>Finally, when Israel called to Jehovah for aid, he raised up Gideon to deliver them.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 8:28</a>) Their princes Oreb and Zeeb were slain, as were their kings Zebah and Zalmunna.

Centuries later the victory over Midian was still alluded to when illustrating the smashing of enemy power.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 9:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:24-26</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 83:9-11</a>.In contrast with the earlier enmity of the Midianites, a restoration prophecy pointed to the time when &#x201C;young male camels of Midian and of Ephah&#x201D; would bring gifts to Zion.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 60:5, 6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> 11-14</a>.<strong>3. </strong>The territory occupied by the Midianites was known as &#x201C;Midian&#x201D; or &#x201C;the land of Midian.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 11:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/26/1\" data-bid=\"27-2\" class=\"b\"> Hab 3:7</a>) It is generally agreed that the descendants of Midian established themselves mainly in the NW part of Arabia just E of the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba. But the extent of their landholdings is uncertain and must have varied in the course of their history. During Moses&#x2019; lifetime many Midianites were apparently living near Moabite territory and in the vicinity of the region controlled by Amorite King Sihon.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 22:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> 31:8-12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/27/2\" data-bid=\"28-3\" class=\"b\"> Jos 13:21</a>.Moses himself spent about 40 years in the land of Midian. There he married Zipporah, one of the seven daughters of Jethro the priest of Midian. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003041/3\">JETHRO</a>.) By her he had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. Moses&#x2019; work as a shepherd for his father-in-law took him to the mountainous area around Horeb, suggesting that he resided in the vicinity of the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba. However, whether the region around Horeb was then a part of &#x201C;the land of Midian&#x201D; cannot be determined.
