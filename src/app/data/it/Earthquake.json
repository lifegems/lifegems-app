The Hebrew noun <em>ra&#x2B9;&#x2BD;ash </em>refers not only to the &#x201C;quaking&#x201D; of the earth, or an &#x201C;earthquake&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 19:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Am 1:1</a>), but also to the &#x201C;tremors&#x201D; caused by a tramping army (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 9:5</a>, ftn), the &#x201C;rattling&#x201D; of war chariots or a javelin (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 47:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Job 41:29</a>), and the &#x201C;pounding&#x201D; of horses (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Job 39:24</a>).

The geology of the area explains Israel&#x2019;s past history of seismic activity, which still is not finished.The temple area of Jerusalem is situated on a line of structural weakness within the earth. The Mosque of el-Aqsa, located in the temple area (not the Dome of the Rock, which is a shrine), has been repeatedly damaged by earthquake activity.A tremendous earthquake, apparently coupled with volcanic action, provided an awe-inspiring setting for the inauguration of the Law covenant at Sinai.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 19:11-18</a>) Earthquakes have been a miraculous aid to Jehovah&#x2019;s people, as when Jonathan and his armor-bearer courageously attacked a Philistine outpost. Jehovah backed up their faith in him by bringing about an earthquake that threw the entire camp of the Philistines into confusion, so that these killed off one another and were thoroughly routed.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 14:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/12/2\" data-bid=\"13-3\" class=\"b\"> 12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/12/3\" data-bid=\"13-4\" class=\"b\"> 15, 16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/12/4\" data-bid=\"13-5\" class=\"b\"> 20,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/12/5\" data-bid=\"13-6\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>.On the day of Jesus&#x2019; death, about three&#xA0;o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, an earthquake took place, splitting rock-masses open, causing the memorial tombs to be opened, and causing dead bodies to be thrown from their graves. The curtain of the sanctuary in the temple rebuilt by Herod was torn in two, from top to bottom. Prior to this, darkness had fallen over the land. Some think that volcanic action was involved, for often volcanoes belch out smoke and dust that blacken the sky. But there is no real evidence that there was any volcanic action connected with this earthquake.

With data obtained from the National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, supplemented by a number of standard reference works, a tabulation was made in 1984 that included only earthquakes that measured 7.5 or more on the Richter scale, or that resulted in destruction of five million dollars (U.S.) or more in property, or that caused 100 or more deaths. It was calculated that there had been 856 of such earthquakes during the 2,000 years before 1914. The same tabulation showed that in <em>just 69 years </em>following 1914 there were 605 of such quakes. These statistics are a means of indicating the extent of suffering from earthquakes during this period of history.<strong>Figurative and Symbolic Uses. </strong>Earthquakes are often used figuratively in the Scriptures to describe the shaking and overthrow of nations and kingdoms. Ancient Babylon trusted in false gods such as Nebo and Marduk, which in the people&#x2019;s imaginations filled their heavens. They also relied greatly on the strength of their mighty military force, but God said in pronouncement against Babylon: &#x201C;I shall cause heaven itself to become agitated, and the earth will rock out of its place at the fury of Jehovah of armies.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 13:13</a>) As far as Babylon was concerned, it must have been a great shock when her empire fell and her territory ceased to belong to her as the third world power and she became merely a province in the Persian Empire.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Da 5:30,&#xA0;31</a>.Elsewhere, David describes Jehovah as fighting for him as by means of an earthquake.

He goes on to follow through with the illustration of the earthquake that took place at Sinai and gives a symbolic application, encouraging Christians to continue serving in courage and faith, realizing that the Kingdom and those who hold on to it will be able to remain standing while all other things of the symbolic heavens and earth are shaken to pieces.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 12:18-29</a>.The greatest earthquake of all yet to come is a symbolic one, described in connection with the seventh of the symbolic seven final plagues of Revelation. It is pictured as wrecking, not one or two cities, as some of the most violent earthquakes have done, but &#x201C;the cities of the nations.&#x201D; John&#x2019;s account of this cataclysm reads: &#x201C;A great earthquake occurred such as had not occurred since men came to be on the earth, so extensive an earthquake, so great. And the great city [Babylon the Great] split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001240/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Re 16:18,&#xA0;19</a>."}
