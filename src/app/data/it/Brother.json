The claim that &#x201C;brother&#x201D; (<em>a&#xB7;del&#xB7;phos&#x2B9;</em>) here means &#x201C;cousin&#x201D; (<em>a&#xB7;ne&#xB7;psi&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>) is a theoretical contention, the invention of which <span id=\"page370\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"370\" data-before-text=\"370\"></span>is credited to Jerome, and dates back no earlier than 383&#xA0;C.E. Not only does Jerome fail to cite any support for his newborn hypothesis but in later writings he wavers in his opinions and even expresses misgivings about his &#x201C;cousin theory.&#x201D; J.&#xA0;B.&#xA0;Lightfoot states that &#x201C;St Jerome pleaded no traditional authority for his theory, and that therefore the evidence in its favour is to be sought in Scripture alone. I have examined the scriptural evidence, and the .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. combination of difficulties .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. more than counterbalances these secondary arguments in its favour, and in fact must lead to its rejection.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>St.&#xA0;Paul&#x2019;s Epistle to the Galatians, </em>London, 1874, p.&#xA0;258.In the Greek Scriptures where the account involved a nephew or cousin, <em>a&#xB7;del&#xB7;phos&#x2B9; </em>is not used. Rather, the relationship is explained, as &#x201C;the son of Paul&#x2019;s sister&#x201D; or &#x201C;Mark the cousin [<em>a&#xB7;ne&#xB7;psi&#xB7;os&#x2B9;</em>] of Barnabas.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 23:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/32/1\" data-bid=\"33-2\" class=\"b\"> Col 4:10</a>) In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 21:16</a>, the Greek words <em>syg&#xB7;ge&#xB7;non&#x2B9; </em>(relatives, such as cousins) and <em>a&#xB7;del&#xB7;phon&#x2B9; </em>(brothers) both occur, showing that the terms are not used loosely or indiscriminately in the Greek Scriptures.When, during Jesus&#x2019; ministry, &#x201C;his brothers were, in fact, not exercising faith in him,&#x201D; this would certainly rule out their being his brothers in a spiritual sense. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 7:3-5</a>) Jesus contrasted these fleshly brothers with his disciples, who believed in him and who were his spiritual brothers.
