(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000717/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:58</a>) The name is still preserved at Burj es-Sur, while excavations have shown the actual site of the ancient city to be at Khirbet et-Tubeiqeh (Bet Zur), about 0.5&#xA0;km (0.3&#xA0;mi) to the NW. This location is 7.5&#xA0;km (4.5&#xA0;mi) N of Hebron, with Gedor about 5&#xA0;km (3&#xA0;mi) farther NNW and Halhul 1.5&#xA0;km (1&#xA0;mi) to the SSE. It is described as one of the highest ruined towns in Palestine, being situated on a hill 1,007&#xA0;m (3,304&#xA0;ft) above sea level. As it was near the highway leading N-S along the ridge of the watershed route and also guarded the routes leading to Mareshah and Libnah in the W, Beth-zur occupied a position of strategic importance.Following the division of the kingdom, Beth-zur was one of 15 cities rebuilt and fortified by King Rehoboam as a means of protecting Judah and Benjamin against invasion. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000717/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 11:5-12</a>) It was among the cities reinhabited by the Jews returning from the Babylonian exile. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000717/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:16</a>) During the Maccabean period Beth-zur (then called Bethsura) figured prominently in the Jews&#x2019; struggle against the Seleucid kings of Syria, the Apocryphal book of First Maccabees describing a signal victory won there by Judas Maccabaeus against the Syrian forces (165&#xA0;B.C.E.), following which he fortified the city again. (1 Maccabees 4:61; 6:26) In 162&#xA0;B.C.E. the Syrians besieged the city, and it eventually capitulated because of lack of food supplies. (1 Maccabees 6:30-50) It became a Syrian garrison, and General Bacchides strengthened its fortifications.<wbr>&#x2014;1 Maccabees 9:52.Archaeological excavations at Beth-zur in 1931 and 1957 revealed evidence of strong fortifications. Numerous coins were found dating from the fourth to the second century B.C.E.; these included silver Jewish coins believed to date from the Persian period or about the fourth century B.C.E.The name Beth-zur appears in a genealogical list of the descendants of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000717/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 2:45</a>. Maon is there said to be &#x201C;the father of Beth-zur.&#x201D; Many commentators understand Beth-zur to refer to the town of that name, Maon in such case being the father of those settling there, or perhaps the chief or principal one of the city."}
