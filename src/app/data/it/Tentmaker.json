(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004364/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 21:39</a>) Among the Jews of the first century C.E., it was considered honorable to teach a lad a trade even if he was to receive a higher education. So Paul likely gained experience in the manufacture of tents while still a youth. Tentmaking may also have been the type of work the apostle did in Thessalonica (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004364/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Th 2:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004364/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Th 3:8</a>) and other places.
