Still another view is that &#x201C;Sheshach&#x201D; stood for <em>SiskuKI </em>of an old Babylonian royal register. <em>Sisku </em>or <em>Siska </em>may have been a district of ancient Babylon. Jewish tradition, however, has it that Sheshach is a cipher for the Hebrew name Babel (or, Babylon), by the device known as athbash. According to this cryptographic system, the true name is disguised by replacing the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet (<em>taw</em>) with the first (<em>&#x2BC;a&#x2B9;leph</em>), and the second-last letter (<em>shin</em>) with the second (<em>behth</em>), and so on. Consequently, in &#x201C;Babel&#x201D; each <em>behth </em>(b)&#xA0;would be changed to <em>shin </em>(sh), and the <em>la&#x2B9;medh </em>(l)&#xA0;to <em>kaph </em>(kh), thus becoming <em>She&#xB7;shakh&#x2B9;. </em>The name Sheshach may also imply humiliation, for which Babylon was due.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004022/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 25:26</a>, ftn; <em>Soncino Books of the Bible, </em>edited by A.&#xA0;Cohen, London, 1949."}
