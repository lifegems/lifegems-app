But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:7,&#xA0;8</a>) A man can be termed &#x201C;righteous&#x201D; if he fulfills his proper obligations, is just, impartial, honest, not guilty of wrongdoing or immorality, hence one known for integrity of conduct and uprightness. Paul&#x2019;s statement, however, implies a certain superiority in &#x201C;the good&#x201D; man. To be &#x201C;good,&#x201D; the individual could not, of course, be unrighteous or unjust; yet other qualities distinguish him from the man primarily known for his righteousness. The use of the Greek term shows that the person noteworthy for, or distinguished by, goodness is one who is benevolent (disposed to do good or bring benefit to others) and beneficent (actively expressing such goodness). He is not merely concerned with doing what justice requires but goes beyond this, being motivated by wholesome consideration for others and the desire to benefit and help them.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:10-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 6:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/3\" data-bid=\"9-4\" class=\"b\"> 33,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/4\" data-bid=\"9-5\" class=\"b\"> 35, 36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/5\" data-bid=\"9-6\" class=\"b\"> Joh 7:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/6\" data-bid=\"9-7\" class=\"b\"> Ac 14:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/7\" data-bid=\"9-8\" class=\"b\"> Ro 12:20, 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/8/8\" data-bid=\"9-9\" class=\"b\"> 1Th 5:15</a>.Thus, Paul evidently is showing that, while the man noted for being &#x201C;righteous&#x201D; may win the respect, even the admiration, of others, he may not appeal to their heart so strongly as to impel anyone to die for him. However, the man outstanding for his goodness, who is warm, helpful, considerate, merciful, actively beneficial, wins affection; and his goodness may appeal to the heart sufficiently that, for such a one, a person might be willing to die.It may be noted that, in the Scriptures, that which is &#x201C;good&#x201D; is contrasted with that which is &#x201C;vile&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 5:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 9:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Co 5:10</a>), &#x201C;wicked&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:45;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 12:9</a>), &#x201C;evil&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 16:19</a>), and, of course, &#x201C;bad&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 3Jo&#xA0;11</a>).

Therefore, only through acceptance of God&#x2019;s provision of his Son could they attain righteousness. <span id=\"page811\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"811\" data-before-text=\"811\"></span>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:3,&#xA0;4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/36/1\" data-bid=\"37-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 7:18-28</a>) Those accepting Christ were declared righteous, not as something earned, but as a <em>gift, </em>and Christ became to them &#x201C;wisdom from God, also righteousness and sanctification and release by ransom.&#x201D; Accordingly, real righteousness can come only through Christ. This exalts Jehovah, giving him, and not man or self-works, the credit as the Source of all righteousness, &#x201C;that it may be just as it is written: &#x2018;He that boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.&#x2019;&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 1:30, 31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 5:17</a>.<strong>Benefits of Righteousness. </strong>God loves the righteous and cares for them. David wrote: &#x201C;A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 37:25</a>) Solomon said: &#x201C;Jehovah will not cause the soul of the righteous one to go hungry, but the craving of the wicked ones he will push away.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 10:3</a>) God is to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by Jesus Christ, and he will create &#x201C;new heavens and a new earth&#x201D; in which righteousness is to dwell.

And the possessions of the wicked will go to the righteous, as the proverb states: &#x201C;The wealth of the sinner is something treasured up for the righteous one.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 13:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/41/1\" data-bid=\"42-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:18</a>.The person who perseveres in righteousness is assured of God&#x2019;s goodwill and the approval of righthearted men now and for all time to come, for &#x201C;the remembrance of the righteous one is due for a blessing [and will be &#x201C;to time indefinite&#x201D;], but the very name of the wicked ones will rot.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 10:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/42/1\" data-bid=\"43-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 112:6</a>.<strong>Respect and Heed Righteous Ones. </strong>It is the course of wisdom to respect those whom Jehovah counts righteous and to follow their counsel and reproof, which will bring good to those accepting it. David received reproof from Jehovah through righteous men, God&#x2019;s servants and prophets, and he said: &#x201C;Should the righteous one strike me, it would be a loving-kindness; and should he reprove me, it would be oil upon the head, which my head would not want to refuse.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 141:5</a>.<strong>&#x201C;The Breastplate of Righteousness.&#x201D; </strong>Because the Bible tells us, &#x201C;More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life,&#x201D; Christians need to have on &#x201C;the breastplate of righteousness.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 4:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/44/1\" data-bid=\"45-2\" class=\"b\"> Eph 6:14</a>) As a protection against his heart turning bad, it is essential that a person follow God&#x2019;s righteousness since the heart of fallen, sinful man is treacherous and desperate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 17:9</a>) The heart needs much discipline and training. The Christian can be assured of this course only by sticking close to the Scriptures, which, the apostle Paul says, are &#x201C;beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.&#x201D; He should accept gratefully the discipline that is received from righteous men who make such use of God&#x2019;s Word.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003733/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 3:16,&#xA0;17</a>."}
