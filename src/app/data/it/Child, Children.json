The procreation mandate is expressed at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 1:28</a>. It is a normal desire of people to have children. The ancient Israelites were especially concerned about bringing forth children because of God&#x2019;s promise to make them a mighty nation and because through them would come the seed of Abraham by means of whom all the families of the earth would bless themselves. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 28:14</a>) Having many children was considered a blessing from God.

The preference for a boy lay in the fact that it assured a continuance of the family line and name, and it assured the holding of family property. The priority of the male is also indicated by the fact that the purification period under the Law was twice as long for female births. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Le 12:2-5</a>) The firstborn son belonged to Jehovah and was to be redeemed by an offering.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 13:12, 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/16/1\" data-bid=\"17-2\" class=\"b\"> Nu 18:15</a>.Anciently, at birth the infant was first washed with water, then rubbed with salt.

Under exceptional circumstances, such as a mother&#x2019;s dying or being unable to furnish milk, nurses were employed.In earlier history names were given to children at birth, either by the father (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 5:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/19/3\" data-bid=\"20-4\" class=\"b\"> 35:18</a>) or by the mother (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 4:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 29:32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 1:20</a>), but in later times in Israel names were given to the boys at the time of circumcision, which was on the eighth day.

As time elapsed, certain names became merely traditional and had nothing to do with the original meaning.Mothers used various methods to transport their young children. At times the child was bundled on the back or carried on the shoulder. Jehovah through Isaiah alludes to mothers clutching their children to their bosom, hoisting them on their shoulders, or carrying them on the flank, just above the hip. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 49:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\"> 66:12</a>) Also, the words of Moses indicate that children were carried in the bosom.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:12</a>.Boys were mainly cared for by the mother until about five years of age. Of course, the father had the primary responsibility of teaching the child the Scriptures from its infancy, and the mother assisted.

Both Joseph and David were young shepherd lads.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 37:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 16:11</a>.Girls were under the immediate care of the mother, subject, of course, to the father&#x2019;s jurisdiction. While at home they were taught the domestic arts that would be of value in adult life. Rachel was a shepherdess.

Samuel as a boy was used to minister to Jehovah at the tabernacle. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 2:11</a>) Jesus was very concerned with the service of his Father when he was only 12 years of age, learning all that he could by talking to the teachers in the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:41-49</a>) A little Hebrew girl, who had implicit faith in Jehovah and his prophet Elisha, was the one responsible for directing Naaman to Elisha to be healed of leprosy. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 5:2,&#xA0;3</a>) At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 148:12, 13</a> both boys and girls are commanded to praise Jehovah. Because of their training in the Bible, boys were able to cry out when they saw Jesus at the temple, saying: &#x201C;Save, we pray, the Son of David!&#x201D; and Jesus commended them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 21:15,&#xA0;16</a>.The parents were the ones responsible for the education and training of their children, they themselves being the instructors and guides, both by word and by example. The educational program was as follows: (1)&#xA0;Fear of Jehovah was taught. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 34:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/35/1\" data-bid=\"36-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 9:10</a>) (2)&#xA0;The child was admonished to honor his father and mother.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">De 4:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/37/2\" data-bid=\"38-3\" class=\"b\"> 6:7-21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/37/3\" data-bid=\"38-4\" class=\"b\"> Ps 78:5</a>) (4)&#xA0;Respect for older persons was stressed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Le 19:32</a>) (5)&#xA0;The importance of obedience was indelibly stamped on the youngster&#x2019;s mind. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 4:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/39/1\" data-bid=\"40-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/39/2\" data-bid=\"40-3\" class=\"b\"> 23:22-25</a>) (6)&#xA0;Stress was put on practical training for adult living, such as teaching girls to do things around the home, or teaching boys the trade of the father or some other trade. (7)&#xA0;Education in reading and writing was given.After the Babylonian exile, synagogues existed in most cities, and in later times boys were instructed by teachers there. Additionally, religious instruction was given as the parents took their children with them when going to the assemblies that were held for the purpose of worshiping and praising Jehovah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">De 31:12, 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> Ne 12:43</a>) Jesus&#x2019; parents had taken him up to Jerusalem for the Passover.

The son was brought before the older men of the city, and after testimony from the parents that he was an irreformable offender, the delinquent suffered capital punishment by stoning. Such arrangement evidently had reference to a son beyond the age of what is usually considered a young child, for this one the Scriptures describe as &#x201C;a glutton and a drunkard.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">De 21:18-21</a>) One striking his father or mother, or calling down evil upon his parents, was put to death. The reason for such strong measures was that the nation might clear away what was bad from their midst and so that &#x201C;all Israel [would] hear and indeed become afraid.&#x201D; Therefore, any tendency in the nation toward juvenile delinquency or disrespect of parental authority would be greatly retarded by the punishment inflicted upon such offenders.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/43/1\" data-bid=\"44-2\" class=\"b\"> 17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/43/2\" data-bid=\"44-3\" class=\"b\"> Mt 15:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/43/3\" data-bid=\"44-4\" class=\"b\"> Mr 7:10</a>.Great disrespect was shown to God&#x2019;s appointed prophet Elisha by a group of small boys who derided him, crying out: &#x201C;Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!&#x201D; They wanted Elisha, who was wearing Elijah&#x2019;s familiar garment, either to go on his way up to Bethel or to get off the earth as Elijah was supposed to have done. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 2:11</a>) They did not want him around. Elisha finally turned and called down evil upon them in the name of Jehovah. &#x201C;Then two she-bears came out from the woods and went tearing to pieces forty-two children of their number.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000952/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 2:23,&#xA0;24</a>.Jesus prophesied that children would rise up against their parents and parents against their children because of the stand that they would take as followers of him.

As long as the father was alive and able to manage the household, the sons were subject to him. However, if a son finally set <span id=\"page436\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"436\" data-before-text=\"436\"></span>up an independent home, then he became the head of his own household. Children could be sold into temporary bondage by a father for the payment of debts contracted.
