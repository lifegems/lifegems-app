In Bible times various means were employed for restraint of prisoners, including fetters, stocks, shackles, and handcuffs, as well as prison houses.In the Scriptures the Hebrew word <em>necho&#x2B9;sheth, </em>usually meaning &#x201C;copper,&#x201D; is frequently translated &#x201C;fetters of copper&#x201D; or &#x201C;copper fetters,&#x201D; because fetters were often made of copper or bronze, although wood and iron were also employed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 3:34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 25:7</a>) At Tocra, Libya, iron fetters were found closely resembling those pictured on Assyrian palace reliefs. Metal loops or bands 13&#xA0;cm (5&#xA0;in.) in diameter, large enough to encase the ankles, are linked by a flat bar. The bar, measured from end to end, is 18&#xA0;cm (7&#xA0;in.), which would force very small steps, making it difficult to walk. The Greek word for a &#x201C;fetter&#x201D; is <em>pe&#x2B9;de, </em>related to <em>pous </em>(foot).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 8:29</a>.The Hebrew verb <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;sar&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;tie; bind; put in bonds&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 16:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Eze 3:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 23:33</a>), is the root of three other words having to do with bondage. <span id=\"page351\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"351\" data-before-text=\"351\"></span><em>&#x2BC;E&#xB7;sur&#x2B9; </em>refers to &#x201C;fetters&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 37:15</a>), <em>moh&#xB7;se&#xB7;rohth&#x2B9; </em>to &#x201C;bands&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 2:3</a>), and <em>ma&#xB7;so&#x2B9;reth </em>to a &#x201C;bond&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000787/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 20:37</a>).
