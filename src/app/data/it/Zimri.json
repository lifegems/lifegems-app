For this, Zimri and Cozbi were slain by Phinehas, with Jehovah&#x2019;s approval. This quick action put an end to the scourge that had already caused the death of thousands of guilty Israelites.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004737/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 25:6-8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004737/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 14-18</a>.<strong>3. </strong>Fifth king of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel. Zimri ruled in Tirzah for seven days in about 951&#xA0;B.C.E. He had previously been chief of half the chariots under King Elah, but when the army was away at Gibbethon, and King Elah had remained behind, Zimri killed him and all the rest of Baasha&#x2019;s house and made himself king. His rule was very short because the army made Omri king and immediately returned to besiege Tirzah, whereupon Zimri burned the king&#x2019;s house down over himself. Zimri is noted for doing what was bad in Jehovah&#x2019;s eyes.

As Jehu triumphantly rode into Jezreel, she taunted from the window: &#x201C;Did it go all right with Zimri the killer of his lord?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004737/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 9:30,&#xA0;31</a>.<strong>4. </strong>A descendant of Saul and Jonathan.
