However, in the Christian Greek Scriptures it is used primarily with regard to religious defection; a withdrawal or abandonment of the true cause, worship, and service of God, and hence an abandonment of what one has previously professed and a total desertion of principles or faith. The religious leaders of Jerusalem charged Paul with such an apostasy against the Mosaic Law.It may properly be said that God&#x2019;s Adversary was the first apostate, as is indicated by the name Satan. He caused the first human pair to apostatize.

In these cases the Hebrew noun <em>cha&#xB7;neph&#x2B9; </em>is used, meaning &#x201C;[one] alienated from God,&#x201D; that is, an apostate. The related verb <em>cha&#xB7;neph&#x2B9; </em>means &#x201C;be inclined away from the right relation to God,&#x201D; or &#x201C;pollute, lead to apostasy.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>by L.&#xA0;Koehler and W.&#xA0;Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;317.<strong>Apostasy in Israel. </strong>The first two commandments of the Law condemned all apostasy.
