Shovels made of copper were employed at the tabernacle for clearing away the ashes from the altar of burnt offering.

John the Baptizer prophetically described the Messiah as having in hand a figurative winnowing shovel, with which he would separate symbolic &#x201C;wheat&#x201D; from &#x201C;chaff.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004084/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 3:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004084/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 12</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004084/0\">WINNOWING</a>."}
