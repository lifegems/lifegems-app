Their welfare was, therefore, provided for under the Law, which ensured justice for the fatherless boy, the widow, and the alien resident and also included provisions for their sustenance.

From this tithe the fatherless boy was legally entitled to a portion.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001496/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">De 14:28, 29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001496/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 26:12,&#xA0;13</a>.<strong><em>How important is loving concern for orphans among God&#x2019;s servants?</em></strong>Since it was easy to lose sight of these bereaved and defenseless ones, Jehovah used the expression &#x201C;fatherless boy&#x201D; in describing the degree of Israel&#x2019;s righteousness or of its deviation therefrom. When the nation was enjoying good spiritual health, the fatherless boy was cared for. When justice became perverted in the land, the fatherless boy was sure to be neglected, and this was a symptom of national decay.
