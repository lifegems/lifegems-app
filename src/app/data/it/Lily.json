According to Koehler and Baumgartner, the Hebrew designation is derived from an Egyptian word meaning &#x201C;big flower.&#x201D; (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;958) The Greek historian Herodotus (II,&#xA0;92) speaks of the Egyptian lotus as &#x201C;lily,&#x201D; and many believe that in the Scriptural references to the &#x201C;lily&#x201D; or &#x201C;lily work&#x201D; in ornamentation, the Egyptian lotus, a water lily, is meant.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002745/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 5:13</a>) Possibly with reference to the lily&#x2019;s beauty, Hosea, in foretelling Israel&#x2019;s restoration, spoke of the time when God&#x2019;s people would blossom as a lily.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002745/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 14:5</a>.In de-emphasizing the importance generally attached to material things, Jesus Christ pointed out that not even Solomon in all his glory was as beautifully arrayed as the lilies of the field. It has been suggested that Jesus probably had the <span id=\"page256\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"256\" data-before-text=\"256\"></span>anemone in mind. However, he may simply have been referring to lilylike flowers in general, as may be inferred from the fact that &#x201C;lilies of the field&#x201D; is used in parallel with &#x201C;vegetation of the field.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002745/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:28-30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002745/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 12:27,&#xA0;28</a>.The significance of the expressions &#x201C;The Lily,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Lilies,&#x201D; appearing in the superscriptions of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002745/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Psalms 45,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002745/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 60,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002745/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 69</a>, and 80, is not known."}
