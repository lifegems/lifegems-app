While yet a child, Hadad, along with some of his father&#x2019;s servants, fled down to Egypt by way of Paran to escape Joab&#x2019;s slaughter of all the males of Edom. In Egypt, Hadad and those with him were kindly received, Pharaoh giving Hadad a house as well as food and land, and later even his own sister-in-law as a wife. By this woman, Hadad had a son named Genubath, who lived right in Pharaoh&#x2019;s house among the sons of Pharaoh. Upon learning that King David and Joab had died, Hadad returned to Edom and proved to be a resister to Solomon.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001797/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 11:14-22,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001797/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;25</a>.<strong>5. </strong>Hadad is considered to be the chief deity of ancient Syria and is generally identified with Rimmon.
