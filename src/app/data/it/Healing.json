The Hebrew verb <em>ra&#xB7;pha&#x2BC;&#x2B9; </em>and the Greek verb <em>i&#xB7;a&#x2B9;o&#xB7;mai </em>are the principal words in the Bible that describe such healing in both a literal and a figurative sense. The Greek verb <em>the&#xB7;ra&#xB7;peu&#x2B9;o </em>is rendered &#x2018;cure.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:23,&#xA0;24</a>) Sometimes the healing was a gradual matter; at other times it was instantaneous.Among the blessings Jehovah bestowed on all mankind is the regenerative power of their physical organisms, the ability of the body to heal itself when wounded or diseased. A physician may recommend certain measures to speed recovery, but in reality it is the God-given recuperative powers within the body that accomplish the healing. Hence, the psalmist David acknowledged that though he was born imperfect, his Creator was able to sustain him during illness and heal all his maladies.

Attention is called to the responsibility of natural Israel&#x2019;s leaders in these matters. &#x201C;From the prophet even to the priest, each one [was] acting falsely&#x201D; in Jeremiah&#x2019;s day, they at the same time making a pretense of healing the breakdown of God&#x2019;s people, claiming that all was well.
