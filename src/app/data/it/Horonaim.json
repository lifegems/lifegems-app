However, the possible meaning of its name has led some to identify Horonaim tentatively with el-&#x2BD;Iraq (meaning &#x201C;Cave&#x201D;), situated about 490&#xA0;m (1,600&#xA0;ft) below the level of the Moabite plateau and about 18&#xA0;km (11&#xA0;mi) E of the southern end of the Dead Sea. Horonaim may be the same as the &#x201C;Hauronen&#x201D; mentioned in the Moabite Stone as having been taken in battle by Mesha the king of Moab."}
