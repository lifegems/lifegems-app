Jerusalem was the location of God&#x2019;s temple that had within its precincts the sacrificial altar. Because of this the city was, in effect, God&#x2019;s altar hearth. It was also supposed to be the center of Jehovah&#x2019;s pure worship. However, the message in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000361/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 29:1-4</a> is ominous in content and predicts the destruction due to come to Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians in 607&#xA0;B.C.E., when she would become an &#x201C;altar hearth&#x201D; in a different sense: as a city running with shed blood and consumed by fire and filled with the bodies of victims of the fiery destruction. The underlying causes for this calamity are stated in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000361/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">verses 9 to 16</a>. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000361/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 29:7, 8</a>, however, shows that the nations wreaking such destruction on Jerusalem would fail in their ultimate purpose or goal."}
