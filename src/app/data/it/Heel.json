This part of the human body was often referred to in a figurative way in the Bible. To hold or injure one&#x2019;s heel would retard, or hinder, him. Jacob grabbed the heel of his twin brother Esau as they came out of their mother&#x2019;s womb. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 25:26</a>) For this he was named Jacob, meaning &#x201C;One Seizing the Heel; Supplanter,&#x201D; which had prophetic meaning. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 27:36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Ho 12:2,&#xA0;3</a>) The family head Jacob, in blessing his fifth son Dan, foretold, favorably for Dan, that he would be like a serpent that lies in wait by the roadside and bites the heels of the horse, throwing off its rider. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:17</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/0\">VIPER, HORNED</a>.) The tribe of Dan was at the &#x201C;heel&#x201D; of things as the rear guard of Israel during their wilderness journey, inflicting damage on Israel&#x2019;s enemies.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 10:25</a>.Unfaithful Jerusalem was likened in prophecy to a disreputable woman, to be punished by having her heels &#x201C;treated violently,&#x201D; that is, to be forced to walk over rough terrain, painful to her heels; this occurred when Jerusalem was taken into exile to Babylon in 607&#xA0;B.C.E.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 13:22</a>.King David spoke figuratively of his traitorous companion Ahithophel, saying: &#x201C;[He] has magnified his heel against me.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 41:9</a>) This had a prophetic fulfillment in Judas Iscariot, to whom Jesus applied the text, saying: &#x201C;He that used to feed on my bread has lifted up his heel against me.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 13:18</a>) Thus the expression indicates a treacherous action, one threatening harm to the person against whom the heel is &#x201C;magnified&#x201D; or &#x201C;lifted up.&#x201D;The first recorded prophecy, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 3:15</a>, foretold that the &#x201C;serpent&#x201D; would bruise the &#x2018;seed of the woman&#x2019; in the heel. Though painful, a heel bruise is not permanently disabling. Jesus, the &#x201C;seed&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 3:16</a>), was put to death by the earthly agents of the great Serpent, Satan the Devil (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Re 12:9</a>), but on the third day was recovered from this &#x2018;heel bruise&#x2019; when his Father Jehovah resurrected him.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:22-24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 10:40</a>."}
