In Scripture, &#x201C;worm&#x201D; often appears to denote the larval stage of insects, particularly maggots.

Bildad disparagingly spoke of man as a worm (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004628/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Job 25:6</a>), and it was foretold that the Messiah would be viewed as a reproach and despicable, as a worm. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004628/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 22:6</a>) Jehovah God referred to Israel as a worm, a lowly and helpless creature, seemingly at the mercy of anyone passing by. But Jehovah assured the Israelites of his help and encouraged them not to be afraid.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004628/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 41:14</a>."}
