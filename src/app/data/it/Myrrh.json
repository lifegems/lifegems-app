But generally myrrh is the resin obtained from various thorny shrubs or small trees of the genus <em>Commiphora, </em>such as <em>Commiphora myrrha </em>or <em>Commiphora abyssinica. </em>These shrubs thrive in rocky areas, particularly on limestone hills. Their wood and bark have a strong odor. Although the resin exudes by itself from the stem or from the thick and stiff branches of either variety, the flow can be increased by means of incisions. Initially the resin is soft and sticky but, upon dripping to the ground, it hardens.Myrrh was one of the ingredients for the holy anointing oil.
