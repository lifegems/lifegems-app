The principal Hebrew word for &#x201C;cloud&#x201D; is <em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;nan&#x2B9;, </em>the majority of its occurrences referring to the pillar of &#x201C;cloud&#x201D; that led the Israelites through the desert wilderness.

Also, particularly in August, there are occasional cirrostratus clouds from the W that do not bring rain. Even these are welcomed by the inhabitants, for they afford some shadow and thus slight relief from the heat. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 25:5</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Job 7:2</a>.) In September or October clouds begin to appear more frequently on the western horizon, forming over the Mediterranean, although it is often mid-October before the rainy season really begins. But during the summer there is, in some sections of the country, a mist cloud in the mornings that vanishes soon with the rising of the sun.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 6:4</a>.During the rainy season, a storm can come up very quickly, starting with a very small cloud in the W. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 18:44,&#xA0;45</a>) The hopes of the farmer would be raised by a cloud rising in western parts.

This fact is used as an admonition to God&#x2019;s servants to go ahead with their work under all conditions.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 11:4</a>.The wisdom and mightiness of Jehovah God the Creator are represented in his control over the clouds. He speaks of them as &#x201C;water jars&#x201D; that tip over and empty their contents on the earth. He says: &#x201C;Who can exactly number the clouds in wisdom, or the water jars of heaven<wbr>&#x2014;who can tip them over?&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Job 38:37</a>) He describes the process of evaporation and condensation, saying: &#x201C;He draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain for his mist, so that the clouds trickle, they drip upon mankind abundantly. Indeed, who can understand the cloud layers, the crashings from his booth?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Job 36:27-29</a>.<strong>Illustrative Usage. </strong>Jehovah, whom no man can see and yet live, symbolizes his presence by a cloud. At Mount Sinai, at the time of giving the Law to Israel, a dark cloud covered the mountain; out of the cloud came lightnings and thunder, the blare of a trumpet, and a loud voice.

After this the cloud stood over the Most Holy, in which was the ark of the covenant, and the cloud became a pillar of fire at night. Doubtless this cloud was visible from any part of the camp, marking the camp&#x2019;s center. When it rose, Israel prepared to break camp. When it moved, they followed its direction to the next camping place, although the exact site to set up the camp may have been selected with the help of Hobab, who had a good knowledge of the land, including watering places and other features necessary to a camp of such tremendous proportions.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 40:34-38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> Nu 10:29-32</a>.Inside the Most Holy, over the ark of the covenant, was a cloud that was very brilliant, the only light to illuminate that compartment. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Le 16:2</a>) In post-Biblical Hebrew, it was called the Shechinah. When the high priest went into the Most Holy on Atonement Day with the blood of animals, he was symbolically standing in the presence of Jehovah. At other times, when he did not go into the Most Holy but stood before the curtain to present a matter of importance to Jehovah for his answer, he was considered as standing before Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 27:21</a>.In one instance Jehovah&#x2019;s own voice was heard out of a bright cloud, expressing approval of his only-begotten Son. This was the brilliant cloud overshadowing Jesus and his three apostles Peter, James, and John on the mount of the transfiguration.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 17:5</a>.When Jesus ascended into heaven, according to the record, &#x201C;a cloud caught him up from their vision.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:9</a>) The disciples did not see Jesus riding away on a cloud, but rather, the cloud obscured their vision of him. This helps us to understand Jesus&#x2019; words concerning his presence: &#x201C;They will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory,&#x201D; and Revelation&#x2019;s statement: &#x201C;He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 21:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 24:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/24/2\" data-bid=\"25-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 1:7</a>) In past cases clouds represented invisible presence; but observers could &#x201C;see&#x201D; the meaning with their mental &#x201C;eyes.&#x201D; In this case the physical occurrences that are visible would cause the one looking to &#x201C;see&#x201D; or realize that Christ is invisibly present.<wbr>&#x2014;See also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/25/2\" data-bid=\"26-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 14:14</a>.When Jesus came to earth, with all the identifications of the Messiah, the Jews selfishly refused to acknowledge him because they demanded as a proof of his Messiahship that he literally fulfill the vision at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000996/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>, where the Son of man is shown coming with the clouds of the heavens before the Ancient of Days, Jehovah God, to receive his kingdom.
