According to <em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament </em>by Brown, Driver, and Briggs (1980, pp.&#xA0;337, 338), <em>cha&#xB7;neph&#x2B9;, </em>when used as an adjective, may be defined as &#x201C;profane, irreligious&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;, godless&#x201D;; or, as a verb, &#x201C;be polluted, profane&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;, inclining away from right.&#x201D; In the Scriptures <em>cha&#xB7;neph&#x2B9; </em>appears in parallel with those forgetting God (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 8:13</a>), the wicked (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job 20:5</a>), evildoers (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 9:17</a>), and it is used in contrast with the upright and innocent ones.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Job 17:8</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/0\">APOSTASY</a>.The Greek word rendered &#x201C;hypocrite&#x201D; (<em>hy&#xB7;po&#xB7;kri&#xB7;tes&#x2B9;</em>) means &#x201C;one who answers,&#x201D; as well as meaning a stage actor. Greek and Roman actors employed large masks with mechanical devices for amplifying the voice. Hence, the Greek word <em>hy&#xB7;po&#xB7;kri&#xB7;tes&#x2B9; </em>came to be used in a metaphoric sense to apply to one playing false, or one putting on a pretense. The same word appears in the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Job 34:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 36:13</a>.

Christ classified as such those who claimed to be God&#x2019;s servants but who failed to discern the significance of the time in which they were living and the events that were occurring, while readily drawing conclusions from the appearance of earth and sky as to what the weather would be like.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/9/3\" data-bid=\"10-4\" class=\"b\"> 7:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/9/4\" data-bid=\"10-5\" class=\"b\"> Lu 6:42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/9/5\" data-bid=\"10-6\" class=\"b\"> 12:54-56</a>.Not only did the Son of God while on earth denounce the religious leaders of Israel as hypocrites but he also stated his reasons for doing so. They rendered mere lip service to the Creator, making the word of God invalid because of their traditions.

They put forth every effort to convert someone, only to make him twice as much a subject for Gehenna as they were. They were sticklers for the little things of the Law but disregarded the weightier matters of it<wbr>&#x2014;justice, mercy, and faithfulness. As hypocrites, they possessed only a seemingly clean outward appearance; inside they were full of immoderateness. Like whitewashed graves, outwardly beautiful, they appeared righteous to men, but inside they were &#x201C;full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.&#x201D; They built the graves of the prophets and decorated the memorial tombs of the righteous ones, claiming that they would not have shed the blood of such ones. However, their course of action proved them to be just like their murderous forefathers.

First they resorted to flattery, saying: &#x201C;Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth.&#x201D; Then they posed the catch question: &#x201C;Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?&#x201D; Appropriately Jesus referred to them as hypocrites, since they were not really desirous of getting an answer to their question but merely raised it with a view to trapping Jesus in his speech.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 22:15-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002121/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 20:19-26</a>; PICTURE, Vol.&#xA0;2, p.&#xA0;544.A hypocritical course cannot be concealed indefinitely.
