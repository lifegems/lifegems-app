When about to be caught on one occasion, he and his companion hid in a well, the mouth of which a woman camouflaged with grain. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000156/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 15:27,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000156/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000156/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 17:17-21</a>) When Absalom was killed, a Cushite runner was picked to take the news to David. Ahimaaz kept insisting that he too be allowed to run. Permission granted, he overtook the first runner and, upon approaching the city, was recognized by his running style. &#x201C;This is a good man, and with good news he should come,&#x201D; exclaimed David. It proved to be so; Ahimaaz reported good news and left the bad for the second courier to deliver. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000156/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 18:19-32</a>) Whether Ahimaaz was ever high priest is not certain. Some suggest he may have died before his father, thereby allowing Ahimaaz&#x2019; son Azariah to succeed Zadok.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000156/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 4:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000156/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 6:8-10</a>.<strong>3. </strong>Husband of Solomon&#x2019;s daughter Basemath, and one of the 12 deputies appointed to provide food for the king&#x2019;s household one month out of the year from the territory of Naphtali.
