It is the softest of the palatal letters except for <em>yohdh </em>[&#x5D9;] and corresponds generally to the English &#x201C;g&#x201D; when it has within it the point (daghesh lene); but without this point it is pronounced softer, more down in the throat. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001705/0\">HEBREW, II</a>.) In the Hebrew, this is the first letter in the opening word in each of the eight verses of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001705/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 119:17-24</a>."}
