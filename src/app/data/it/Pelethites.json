When David fled from Jerusalem because of Absalom&#x2019;s rebellion (which a major portion of the army supported), the Pelethites went along with David across the Kidron. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 15:18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>) They also helped put down the rebellion of Sheba (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 20:7</a>), and later they supported David&#x2019;s choice of Solomon as his successor, instead of siding with Adonijah as Joab did. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 1:38,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;44</a>) The Cherethites and Pelethites were not part of the regular army but were a separate division in the service of King David, for Joab is called the head of the army, but, separately, Benaiah was over the Cherethites and Pelethites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 8:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 18:17</a>) Since the Pelethites were not mentioned either before or after the reign of David, it may be concluded that they were his personal servants, rather than a permanent group serving the regal office.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 8:18</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003424/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">23:22, 23</a>.The lack of any positive identification of the Pelethites has given rise to numerous suggestions, among which are two primary schools of thought: (1)&#xA0;The great similarity in Hebrew between the two names Pelethites and Philistines (&#x5E4;&#x5DC;&#x5EA;&#x5D9; [Pelethite] plus only one additional character gives &#x5E4;&#x5DC;&#x5E9;&#x5EA;&#x5D9; [Philistine]) is the basis for saying that they are of the same background, or perhaps that the Pelethites were a branch of the Philistines. Some object to this suggestion that Philistines comprised David&#x2019;s personal bodyguard, but this possibility should not be wholly discounted. (2)&#xA0;On the other hand, the names Cherethites and Pelethites may perhaps be terms designating duty or ranks of service performed by David&#x2019;s bodyguard, the Cherethites serving as executioners, the Pelethites as runners. Such a division of runners is mentioned during the reigns of Saul and later kings.
