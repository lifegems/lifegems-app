Baruch was the son of Neriah and brother of Seraiah, Zedekiah&#x2019;s quartermaster who read Jeremiah&#x2019;s scroll alongside the Euphrates.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000571/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 32:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000571/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 51:59-64</a>.In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim, 625&#xA0;B.C.E., Baruch began writing in a scroll the prophetic message of Jerusalem&#x2019;s doom, dictated by Jeremiah. In the late fall of the following year, 624&#xA0;B.C.E., Baruch read the scroll aloud &#x201C;in the ears of all the people&#x201D; at the entrance of Jehovah&#x2019;s house. He was then summoned to read it to an assembly of the princes, who, moved by what they heard and fearing the consequences when the word got to the king&#x2019;s ears, urged Baruch and Jeremiah to hide. Jehoiakim, upon hearing the denunciation, burned the scroll piece by piece and commanded that Baruch and Jeremiah be brought before him, &#x201C;but Jehovah kept them concealed.&#x201D; At Jeremiah&#x2019;s dictation, Baruch then wrote another scroll like the first, but containing &#x201C;many more words&#x201D; from the mouth of Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000571/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 36:1-32</a>.Sixteen years later, in the tenth year of Zedekiah, only months before Jerusalem was sacked, Baruch took the deeds for the property Jeremiah had purchased from a cousin and put them in an earthenware vessel for preservation and safekeeping.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000571/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 32:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000571/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 9-16</a>.At one point during the writing of the first scroll, when Baruch complained of his weariness, Jehovah warned him: &#x2018;Do not keep on seeking great things for yourself.&#x2019; Nevertheless, because of his faithfulness he was promised preservation and safety &#x2018;in all the places to which he might go,&#x2019; not only during the terrible siege of Jerusalem but also afterwards when the rebellious populace compelled him and Jeremiah to go down to Egypt with them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000571/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 45:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000571/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 43:4-7</a>.<strong>2. </strong>Son of Zabbai; Baruch &#x201C;worked with fervor&#x201D; assisting Nehemiah to rebuild Jerusalem&#x2019;s walls.
