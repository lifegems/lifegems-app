Her failure to scream would have denoted consent and thus would have constituted her an adulteress. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">De 22:23, 24</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 1:18,&#xA0;19</a>.) The fact that an engaged virgin was regarded as being &#x2018;owned&#x2019; by a husband also explains why <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joel 1:8</a> could refer to &#x201C;a virgin&#x201D; as wailing over &#x201C;the owner of her youth.&#x201D;As greater freedom in the Lord&#x2019;s service is enjoyed by those retaining their virginity, the apostle Paul recommended singleness as the better course for Christians having self-control. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 7:25-35</a>) However, regarding those lacking self-control, he observed: &#x201C;If anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virginity, if that is past the bloom of youth, and this is the way it should take place, let him do what he wants; he does not sin. Let them marry.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 7:36</a>.The Greek word rendered &#x201C;virginity&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Corinthians 7:36-38</a> literally means &#x201C;virgin.&#x201D; For this reason the thought has been advanced that Paul was talking about a father&#x2019;s or guardian&#x2019;s duty toward a marriageable daughter. Thus <em>The Jerusalem Bible </em>reads: &#x201C;If there is anyone who feels that it would not be fair to his daughter to let her grow too old for marriage, and that he should do something about it, he is free to do as he likes: he is not sinning if there is a marriage.&#x201D; Another view is that this text pertains to a man&#x2019;s deciding to marry the girl to whom he is engaged. The <em>American Translation </em>states: &#x201C;If a man thinks he is not acting properly toward the girl to whom he is engaged, if his passions are too strong, and that is what ought to be done, let him do as he pleases; it is no sin; let them be married.&#x201D;The context, however, suggests that the reference is not to a virgin girl but to a person&#x2019;s own virginity. One commentator observed: &#x201C;I think the apostle is here continuing his former discourse, and advising unmarried persons, who are at their own disposal, what to do; the man&#x2019;s virgin being meant of his virginity.&#x201D; (<em>Matthew Henry&#x2019;s Commentary on the Whole Bible, </em>1976, Vol.&#xA0;III, p.&#xA0;1036) Since the Greek word <em>par&#xB7;the&#x2B9;nos </em>can include single men, the rendering &#x201C;virginity,&#x201D; as found in the translations by J.&#xA0;B.&#xA0;Rotherham and J.&#xA0;N.&#xA0;Darby as well as in the <em>New World Translation, </em>is appropriate and seems to fit the context best.<strong>Spiritual Virginity. </strong>Even as the high priest in Israel could take only a virgin as his wife (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Le 21:10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 13, 14</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 44:22</a>), so the great High Priest, Jesus Christ, must have only a &#x201C;virgin&#x201D; as his spiritual &#x201C;bride&#x201D; in heaven.

Hence, the apostle Paul was deeply concerned about the purity of the Corinthian congregation, desiring to present it &#x201C;as a chaste virgin to the Christ.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 11:2-6</a>) The bride of Christ is composed of 144,000 spirit-anointed persons who individually maintain their &#x2018;virginity&#x2019; by remaining separate from the world and by keeping themselves morally and doctrinally pure.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Re 14:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;4</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 5:9-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 6:15-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/15/2\" data-bid=\"16-3\" class=\"b\"> Jas 4:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/15/3\" data-bid=\"16-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Jo 8-11</a>.<strong>Messianic Prophecy. </strong>Although the Hebrew word <em>bethu&#xB7;lah&#x2B9; </em>means &#x201C;virgin,&#x201D; another term (<em>&#x2BD;al&#xB7;mah&#x2B9;</em>) appears at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004563/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 7:14</a>: &#x201C;Look!
