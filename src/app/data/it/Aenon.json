The exact locations of these places are uncertain; however, Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea who lived in the third and fourth centuries C.E., indicates a location in the Jordan Valley about 8 Roman miles (12&#xA0;km; 7.5&#xA0;mi) S of Beth-shean. In this area is Tell Ridgha (Tel Shalem), tentatively identified with Salim. Nearby are several springs that might fit Eusebius&#x2019; description of the place called Aenon."}
