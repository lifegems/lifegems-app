(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003327/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 38:2-4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003327/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 2:3</a>) After Onan&#x2019;s childless older brother Er was put to death by Jehovah for wrongdoing, Onan was told by Judah to perform brother-in-law marriage with Er&#x2019;s widow Tamar. If a son was produced, he would not be the founder of Onan&#x2019;s family, and the firstborn&#x2019;s inheritance would belong to him as an heir to Er; whereas if no heir came, Onan would get the inheritance for himself. When Onan had relations with Tamar, he &#x201C;wasted his semen on the earth&#x201D; instead of giving it to her. This was not an act of masturbation on the part of Onan, for the account says &#x201C;when he did have relations with his brother&#x2019;s wife&#x201D; he spilled his semen. Apparently it was a case of &#x201C;coitus interruptus,&#x201D; in which Onan purposely prevented ejaculation of his semen into Tamar&#x2019;s genital tract. For his disobedience to his father, his covetousness, and his sin against the divine arrangement of marriage, not for self-abuse, Onan, himself also childless, was put to death by Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003327/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 38:6-10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003327/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 46:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003327/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Nu 26:19</a>."}
