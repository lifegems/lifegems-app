It is most frequently rendered &#x201C;Lord&#x201D; by translators. When it appears with the name of God (<em>&#x2BC;Adho&#xB7;nai&#x2B9; Yehwih&#x2B9;</em>), as, for example, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 73:28</a>, the expression is translated &#x201C;Lord GOD&#x201D; (<em>AT, KJ, RS</em>); &#x201C;Lord God&#x201D; (<em>Dy </em>[72:28]); &#x201C;Lord, my Master&#x201D; (<em>Kx </em>[72:28]); &#x201C;Lord Jehovah&#x201D; (<em>Yg</em>); &#x201C;Sovereign Lord Jehovah&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>).

(<em>Vine&#x2019;s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words, </em>1981, Vol.&#xA0;3, pp.&#xA0;18,&#xA0;46) It is translated &#x201C;lord,&#x201D; &#x201C;master,&#x201D; &#x201C;owner,&#x201D; and when used in direct address to God is rendered &#x201C;Lord&#x201D; (<em>KJ, Yg, </em>and others), &#x201C;Ruler of all&#x201D; (<em>Kx</em>), &#x201C;Sovereign Lord&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>), at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 2:29,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Acts 4:24</a>, and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 6:10</a>.

That the political governments do not receive their authority from God, that is, that they are not acting by reason of any grant of authority or power from him, is shown at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 13:1, 2</a>, where the seven-headed, ten-horned wild beast is said to get &#x201C;its power and its throne and great authority&#x201D; from the Dragon, Satan the Devil.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Re 12:9</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/0\">BEASTS, SYMBOLIC</a>.So, while God has allowed various rulerships of men to come and go, one of their mighty kings, after having had demonstrated, in his own experience, the fact of Jehovah&#x2019;s sovereignty, was moved to say: &#x201C;His rulership is a rulership to time indefinite and his kingdom is for generation after generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth are being considered as merely nothing, and he is doing according to his own will among the army of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth.

Rather, he has maneuvered them to suit his good purpose, with relation to his will concerning his servants in the earth. Moses said: &#x201C;When the Most High gave the nations an inheritance, when he parted the sons of Adam from one another, he proceeded to fix the boundary of the peoples with regard for the number of the sons of Israel.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">De 32:8</a>.<strong>God&#x2019;s Son as King. </strong>Following the overthrow of the last king to sit on &#x201C;Jehovah&#x2019;s throne&#x201D; in Jerusalem (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 29:23</a>), the prophet Daniel was given a vision describing the future appointment of God&#x2019;s own Son to serve as King.

The account states: &#x201C;I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One. And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.

And why has the Almighty God allowed these things to remain for centuries? The answers lie in a challenge against God&#x2019;s sovereignty that brought forth a paramount issue involving mankind.<strong><em>What God wants in those who serve him. </em></strong>Jehovah God, by his words and acts, has, over the centuries, proved that he is a God of love and undeserved kindness, exercising perfect justice and judgment, and extending mercy to those seeking to serve him.

This one was a spirit creature of God, an angel. When the human pair Adam and Eve were put on earth, this one saw an opportunity to set out on an attack on God&#x2019;s sovereignty. First, he would make an attempt (which proved successful) to turn Eve, then Adam, away from subjection to God&#x2019;s sovereignty. He hoped to establish a rival sovereignty.As for Eve, the person approached first, she certainly had not appreciated her Creator and God, and she had not taken advantage of her opportunity to <em>know </em>him. She listened to the voice of an inferior, ostensibly the serpent, actually the rebellious angel. The Bible does not allude to any surprise on her part at hearing the serpent talk. It does say that the serpent was &#x201C;the most cautious of all the wild beasts of the field that Jehovah God had made.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:1</a>) Whether it ate of the forbidden fruit of &#x201C;the tree of the knowledge of good and bad&#x201D; and then appeared to be made wise, able to speak, is not stated. The rebellious angel, using the serpent to speak to her, presented (as she supposed) the opportunity to become independent, &#x201C;to be like God, knowing good and bad,&#x201D; and succeeded in convincing her that she would not die.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:4,&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/33/2\" data-bid=\"34-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Co 11:3</a>.Adam, who also showed no appreciation and love for his Creator and Provider when faced with rebellion in his household, and who showed no loyalty to stand up for his God when put to the test, succumbed to Eve&#x2019;s persuasiveness. He evidently lost faith in God and His ability to provide all good things for His loyal servant. (Compare what Jehovah said to David after his sin with Bath-sheba, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 12:7-9</a>.) Adam also seemed to be taking offense against Jehovah, as is indicated by his reply when questioned about his wrong act: &#x201C;The <em>woman </em>whom <em>you </em>gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree and so I ate.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:12</a>) He did not believe the Serpent&#x2019;s lie that he would not die, as Eve had, but both Adam and Eve deliberately went in a course of self-determination, rebellion against God.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 2:14</a>.Adam could not say, &#x201C;I am being tried by God.&#x201D; Rather, this principle went into operation: &#x201C;Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 1:13-15</a>) Thus, the three rebels<wbr>&#x2014;the angel, Eve, and Adam&#x2014;<wbr>used the freedom of will with which God had endowed them, to turn from sinlessness to a course of willful sin.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/3\">PERFECTION</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/4\">SIN, I</a>.<strong><em>The point at issue. </em></strong>What was here challenged? Who was reproached and defamed by this challenge of the angel who was later called Satan the Devil, which challenge Adam supported by his rebellious act? Was it the <em>fact </em>of Jehovah&#x2019;s <em>supremacy, </em>the existence of his <em>sovereignty? </em>Was God&#x2019;s sovereignty in danger? No, for Jehovah has supreme authority and power, and no one in heaven or earth can take this out of his hand. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 9:19</a>) The challenge therefore must have been of the <em>rightfulness, deservedness, and righteousness </em>of God&#x2019;s sovereignty<wbr>&#x2014;whether his sovereignty was exercised in a worthy way, righteously, and for the best interests of his subjects or not. An <span id=\"page1011\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1011\" data-before-text=\"1011\"></span>indication of this is the approach to Eve: &#x201C;Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?&#x201D; Here the Serpent intimated that such a thing was unbelievable<wbr>&#x2014;that God was unduly restrictive, withholding something that was the rightful due of the human pair.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:1</a>.<strong><em>What was &#x201C;the tree of the knowledge of good and bad&#x201D;?</em></strong>By taking of the fruit of &#x201C;the tree of the knowledge of good and bad,&#x201D; Adam and Eve expressed their rebellion. The Creator, as Universal Sovereign, was acting wholly within his right in making the law regarding the tree, for Adam, being a created person, and not sovereign, had limitations, and he needed to acknowledge this fact. For universal peace and harmony, it would devolve upon all reasoning creatures to acknowledge and support the Creator&#x2019;s sovereignty. Adam would demonstrate his recognition of this fact by refraining from eating the fruit of that tree. As father-to-be of an earth full of people, he must prove obedient and loyal, even in the smallest thing. The principle involved was: &#x201C;The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 16:10</a>) Adam had the capability for such perfect obedience. There was evidently nothing bad intrinsically in the fruit of the tree itself. (The thing forbidden was not sex relations, for God had commanded the pair to &#x201C;fill the earth.&#x201D; [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:28</a>] It was the fruit of an actual tree, as the Bible says.) What was represented by the tree is well expressed in a footnote on <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 2:17</a>, in <em>The Jerusalem Bible </em>(1966):&#x201C;This knowledge is a privilege which God reserves to himself and which man, by sinning, is to lay hands on, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">3:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/43/1\" data-bid=\"44-2\" class=\"b\"> 22</a>. Hence it does not mean omniscience, which fallen man does not possess; nor is it moral discrimination, for unfallen man already had it and God could not refuse it to a rational being. It is the power of deciding for himself what is good and what is evil and of acting accordingly, a claim to complete moral independence by which man refuses to recognise his status as a created being. The first sin was an attack on God&#x2019;s sovereignty, a sin of pride.&#x201D;<strong><em>God&#x2019;s servants charged with selfishness. </em></strong>A further expression of the issue is found in Satan&#x2019;s statement to God about his faithful servant Job. Satan said: &#x201C;Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.&#x201D; Again, he charged: &#x201C;Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:9-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/44/1\" data-bid=\"45-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:4</a>) Satan therewith charged Job with being not in harmony with God at heart, as serving God obediently only because of selfish considerations, for gain. Satan thereby slandered God as to his sovereignty, and God&#x2019;s servants as to integrity to that sovereignty. He said, in effect, that no man could be put on earth who would maintain integrity to Jehovah&#x2019;s sovereignty if he, Satan, was allowed to put him to the test.Jehovah permitted the issue to be joined. Not, however, because he was unsure of the righteousness of his own sovereignty. He needed nothing proved to himself. It was out of love for his intelligent creatures that he allowed time for the testing out of the matter. He permitted men to undergo a test by Satan, before all the universe. And he gave his creatures the privilege of proving the Devil a liar, and of removing the slander not only from God&#x2019;s name but also from their own. Satan, in his egotistic attitude, was &#x2018;given up to a disapproved mental state.&#x2019; In his approach to Eve, he had evidently been contradictory in his own reasoning. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 1:28</a>) For he was charging God with unfair, unrighteous exercise of sovereignty and, at the same time, was evidently counting on God&#x2019;s fairness: He seemed to think that God would consider Himself obliged to let him live on if he proved his charge concerning the unfaithfulness of God&#x2019;s creatures.<strong><em>Settlement of the issue, a vital need. </em></strong>The settling of the issue was actually a matter vital to all who live, as respects their relationship to God&#x2019;s sovereignty. For, once settled, such an issue would never need to be tried again. It seems apparent that Jehovah desired that full knowledge of all the questions connected with this issue be thoroughly made known and understood. The action that God took engenders confidence in his unchangeableness, it enhances his sovereignty, and it makes that sovereignty even more desirable and firmly established in the minds of all who choose it.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Mal 3:6</a>.<strong><em>A moral issue. </em></strong>The question, then, is not one of might, of raw strength; it is primarily a <em>moral </em>issue. However, because of God&#x2019;s invisibility and because Satan has exerted every effort to blind <span id=\"page1012\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1012\" data-before-text=\"1012\"></span>men&#x2019;s minds, Jehovah&#x2019;s power or even his existence has at times been questioned.

In Egypt he said to Pharaoh: &#x201C;In fact, for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 9:16</a>) Likewise God has allowed a time for this world and its god, Satan the Devil, to exist and develop in their wickedness, and He has set a time for their destruction.

This One, who always did the things pleasing to his Father, would be most anxious to serve for the vindication of Jehovah&#x2019;s sovereignty.
