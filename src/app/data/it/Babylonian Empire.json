(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002904/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:9,&#xA0;10</a>) Jehovah thwarted the purpose of its builders by confusing the people&#x2019;s language and scattering them from there throughout the earth. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002904/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:4-9</a>) Thus it came about that false worship spread from Babylon to other lands.Babylon&#x2019;s defiance of Jehovah eventually led to its downfall. In prophecy, Jehovah depicted Babylon as a lion having eagle&#x2019;s wings; he also foretold its fall and its eventual desolation. On October&#xA0;5, 539&#xA0;B.C.E., in one night, Babylon was taken by Cyrus the Great, whom Jehovah had foretold by name. Babylon fell in the very manner foretold. Eventually the city became &#x201C;piles of stones,&#x201D; never to be rebuilt.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002904/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 51:37</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002904/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 44:27&#x2013;45:2</a>.<strong>[Box on page&#xA0;321]</strong><strong>PRINCIPAL CITIES</strong>  <em>Babylon: </em>Political and religious capital of the empire; many Jewish exiles were here  <em>Tema: </em>Apparently a second capital, established by King Nabonidus, who left Belshazzar in charge at Babylon  <em>Nineveh: </em>Assyrian capital, which fell to a coalition of Chaldeans and Medes in 632&#xA0;B.C.E.  <em>Carchemish: </em>Nebuchadnezzar&#xA0;II defeated Egyptian forces here, establishing Babylonian supremacy in Syria  <em>Jerusalem: </em>Became tributary to Babylon in 620&#xA0;B.C.E.

The city appeared to be impregnable. It was protected by a massive system of double walls. A second set of walls surrounded the eastern part of the city; a wall also served as a protection along the eastern bank of the Euphrates, which ran through the city.
