The word appears in some Bible translations at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004477/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Corinthians 4:3</a>, where Paul says: &#x201C;Now to me it is a very trivial matter that I should be examined by you or by a human tribunal [Gr., <em>an&#xB7;thro&#xB7;pi&#x2B9;nes he&#xB7;me&#x2B9;ras</em>].&#x201D; The Greek expression literally means &#x201C;human day&#x201D; and is understood to refer to a set day, or day set by a human judge for a trial or for rendering judgment.Paul acknowledged that men such as Apollos, Cephas, and himself in a sense belonged to or were servants of the Corinthian congregation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004477/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 3:21,&#xA0;22</a>) Yet some in that congregation were criticizing and judging Paul, which attitude grew out of their sectarianism, their fleshliness rather than spirituality, their looking to men instead of to Christ. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004477/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 9:1-4</a>) Paul ably defended his ministry (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004477/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 9:5-27</a>), setting forth the general rule or view that a Christian should not be primarily concerned about the judgment of men, whether by the Corinthians or by some human court on a set day. Rather, Paul was concerned about the future day of judgment or evaluation by God (through Jesus). He was the one who had given Paul the stewardship to which he must prove faithful.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004477/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 1:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004477/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 4:2-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004477/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 4:13</a>."}
