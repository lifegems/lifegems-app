It was here that Paul was interrogated by the Roman military commander.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000904/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 21:31, 32,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000904/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 37;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000904/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 22:24</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000904/0\">ANTONIA, TOWER OF</a>.&#x201C;Shushan the castle,&#x201D; some 360&#xA0;km (225&#xA0;mi) E of Babylon, was a part-time residence of the Persian king. Here Nehemiah worked as a royal cupbearer before leaving for Jerusalem.

This is supported by certain details given in the account. &#x201C;The house of the women,&#x201D; where the virgins were prepared for presentation to Ahasuerus, was located there.
