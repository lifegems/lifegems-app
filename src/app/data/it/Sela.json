(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003886/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:36</a>) The site is unknown today. Some would identify this Sela with the one in Edom (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003886/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 14:7</a>), but there is no evidence that Amorite territory ever extended so far S into the region controlled by the Edomites.<strong>2. </strong>A major Edomite city that was captured by Judean King Amaziah and renamed Joktheel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003886/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 14:7</a>) Sela may be the unnamed &#x201C;fortified city&#x201D; referred to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003886/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 108:10</a>.This city is identified by some with Umm el-Biyara, a rocky acropolis lying about 100&#xA0;km (60&#xA0;mi) NNE of the northern tip of the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba. This site is located in the western corner of the plain where the Nabataean city of Petra was later built. Accessible by means of a narrow, twisting gorge and surrounded by precipitous sandstone cliffs, this plain is well protected. The impressive ruins of Petra, including temples, tombs, and dwellings hewn out of the rock, were no part of the ancient Edomite city of Sela. Scholars have recently favored identifying Sela with es-Sela&#x2BD;, about 4&#xA0;km (2.5&#xA0;mi) NNW of Bozrah.<strong>3. </strong>A place mentioned in a pronouncement against Moab. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003886/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 15:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003886/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:1</a>) There is uncertainty as to whether or not it is the same site as No.&#xA0;2."}
