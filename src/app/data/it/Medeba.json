The ancient &#x201C;king&#x2019;s road&#x201D; linked it with other cities E of the Jordan. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002955/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 20:17</a>.) Madaba is situated on a treeless but fertile plain, or plateau. In the plain, &#x201C;the tableland of Medeba,&#x201D; flocks of sheep and goats find pasturage.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002955/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002955/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;16</a>.After the Israelites defeated Amorite King Sihon, Medeba came to be in the territory given to <span id=\"page358\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"358\" data-before-text=\"358\"></span>the tribe of Reuben.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002955/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 21:25-30</a>) Several centuries later, in a fight against the Ammonites, the army of King David under Joab&#x2019;s command defeated Aramaean (Syrian) mercenary forces encamped before Medeba.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002955/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 19:6-16</a>.According to the Moabite Stone (line&#xA0;8), Israel&#x2019;s King Omri (c.&#xA0;951-941&#xA0;B.C.E.) took possession of the &#x201C;land of Mehedeba (Medeba).&#x201D; Line 30 of the same monument indicates that Moab&#x2019;s King Mesha rebuilt Medeba and other cities in the area. It may be, however, that the Israelites regained dominion over Medeba when Jeroboam&#xA0;II (c.&#xA0;844-804&#xA0;B.C.E.) &#x201C;restored the boundary of Israel from the entering in of Hamath clear to the sea of the Arabah.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002955/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 14:25</a>) But this would not have been for long, since Isaiah&#x2019;s pronouncement (c.&#xA0;778&#x2013;a.&#xA0;732&#xA0;B.C.E.) against Moab shows that Medeba was by then under the control of the Moabites and it was foretold that the Moabites would &#x2018;howl&#x2019; over the loss of the city.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002955/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 15:1,&#xA0;2</a>."}
