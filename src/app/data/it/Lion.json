However, when trying to prey upon domestic animals in an enclosure, a lion <span id=\"page257\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"257\" data-before-text=\"257\"></span>often will roar. The terrifying sound is calculated to cause a stampede to break down the protective fence and to isolate individual animals from the flock. The animal does well in its pacing.

In procuring its food, the animal either resorts to ambush or stalks its prey until close enough to make a short rush.

In order to gain necessary experience in killing prey, lion cubs begin to accompany their mother on hunts when three months old.
