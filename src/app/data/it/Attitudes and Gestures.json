These Orientals are considerably more demonstrative and less inhibited in the expression of their feelings than are many of the Western peoples. Either accompanied by words or without words, attitudes and gestures carried considerable force and meaning.<strong>Prayer and Homage. </strong><em>Standing. </em>Among the Hebrews and many of the other nations mentioned in the Bible, there was no set form of posture for prayer. All the attitudes assumed were highly respectful. Standing was a common posture. Jesus spoke of this position for prayer. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 11:25</a>) Immediately after being baptized, Jesus was evidently standing and praying when the heaven was opened up and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, and God&#x2019;s own voice was heard from the heavens.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 3:21,&#xA0;22</a>.<em>Kneeling </em>was a common attitude of prayer.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 8:54</a>) While many of the instances in the Bible use the word &#x201C;knees&#x201D; in the plural, it may be that at times a person would kneel upon one knee, as is done sometimes by modern Orientals.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 9:40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> Eph 3:14</a>.<em>Bowing. </em>The Jews, wherever they were found, when worshiping turned their faces toward the city of Jerusalem and its temple.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 8:16</a>) Temples of the sun worshipers were built in such a manner that the entrance was on the W side, making the worshipers face E on entering. But the temple of Jehovah was built with the entrance in the E so that the worshipers of Jehovah there turned their backs on the place of the rising of the sun.<em>Extending the arms. </em>In the postures of standing and kneeling, the palms of the hands would sometimes be spread out to the heavens, or the hands would be lifted up or extended forward as in supplication.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 17:16</a>) From this position he could bow his <span id=\"page216\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"216\" data-before-text=\"216\"></span>head or rest it on his bosom. Or, as Elijah did, he might crouch to the earth and put his face between his knees.

This was usually done by falling on the knees and bowing forward, resting on the hands or, more often, the elbows, with the head touching the ground.

Job realized that this was a denial of the true God and would require an accounting for such error.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Job 31:26-28</a>.<em>Christian postures for prayer. </em>Jesus prayed publicly, in sincerity, as did Paul and others.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:5,&#xA0;6</a>) But Jesus condemned ostentatiousness in making long prayers for a pretense, a practice into which some of the scribes had fallen.

Nowhere do they give support to a facial or bodily attitude of assumed piety and sanctimoniousness. They do not make any given posture, such as placing the palms together or clasping the hands when offering prayer, essential. In fact, prayers can be made silently and completely without outward manifestation, when the individual is carrying on an assigned duty or is faced with an emergency. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:4</a>.) Christians are told to carry on prayer &#x201C;with every form of prayer and supplication.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 6:18</a>.<strong>Respect, Humility. </strong><em>Kneeling. </em>The attitudes and postures of the Orientals in expressing respect for one another and especially when petitioning superiors were much the same as the attitudes assumed in prayer. We find examples of kneeling in supplication before others. This was not in worship of the person but in acknowledgment of that one&#x2019;s position or office, with deep respect.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 17:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/21/1\" data-bid=\"22-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 1:40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/21/2\" data-bid=\"22-3\" class=\"b\"> 10:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/21/3\" data-bid=\"22-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 1:13</a>.<em>Bowing </em>was more frequently used in greeting others, in approaching them on a matter of business, or in displaying a high degree of respect. Jacob bowed seven times on meeting Esau. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 33:3</a>) Solomon, even though he was king, showed respect to his mother by bowing to her.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 2:19</a>.Bowing could also be a symbol of acknowledgment of defeat. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 60:14</a>) Those persons defeated might appear before their conqueror in sackcloth and, additionally, with ropes upon their heads in an appeal for mercy.

This was because Haman, as an Agagite, was very likely an Amalekite, concerning whom Jehovah had said that he would completely wipe out their remembrance from under the heavens and that he would have war with Amalek from generation to generation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 17:14-16</a>) Since bowing down or prostration would have a connotation of peace toward Haman, Mordecai refused to perform this act, because he would have violated God&#x2019;s command in doing so.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Es 3:5</a>.<em>Prostrating. </em>Joshua prostrated himself before an angel, &#x201C;as prince of the army of Jehovah,&#x201D; not in worship, but in acknowledgment of the superior office the angel held and of the fact that the angel was obviously sent from Jehovah with a command for him.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 5:14</a>.When Jesus was on earth, persons would prostrate themselves before him to petition and to do obeisance to him, and he did not reprove them.

This was because, in the instances described, prostration was done as an attitude of worship, as though the power of the holy spirit in the apostles, which performed the healing and other powerful works, were their own. The apostles realized that the power was from God and that credit for these things should be given to him and all worship should be directed toward Jehovah <span id=\"page217\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"217\" data-before-text=\"217\"></span>through Jesus Christ, of whom they were merely the representatives.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 10:25,&#xA0;26</a>.In connection with the respect paid to Jesus, the word often used is <em>pro&#xB7;sky&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;o, </em>a word having the basic meaning &#x201C;do obeisance,&#x201D; but also translated &#x201C;worship.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 2:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 4:8</a>) Jesus was not accepting worship, which belongs to God alone (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:10</a>), but recognized the act of the one doing obeisance as recognition of the authority given Him by God. The angel whom Jesus Christ sent to bring the Revelation to John expressed the principle that man&#x2019;s worship belongs only to God, when he refused to accept worship from John.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Re 19:10</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/0\">OBEISANCE</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/1\">WORSHIP</a>.<em>Covering the head </em>was a sign of respect on the part of women. This custom was followed in the Christian congregation. In discussing the principle of Christian headship, the apostle Paul stated: &#x201C;Every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 11:3-10</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/2\">HEADSHIP</a>.<em>Removing one&#x2019;s sandals </em>was a gesture of respect or reverence.

Likewise, the loosening of the laces of another person&#x2019;s sandals or bearing his sandals for him was considered a menial duty and an expression of one&#x2019;s humility and consciousness of insignificance when contrasted with his master. It is still a practice in the Middle East that when one enters a house, his sandals are taken off, sometimes by a servant.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 3:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 1:27</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/3\">SANDAL</a>.<em>Pouring water on another&#x2019;s hands. </em>Elisha was identified as the minister or servant of Elijah by the expression &#x201C;[he] poured out water upon the hands of Elijah.&#x201D; This was a service performed particularly after meals. In the Middle East it was not the custom to use knives and forks, but fingers, and the servant would afterward pour water over the hands of his master for washing. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 3:11</a>) A similar practice was the washing of feet, performed as an act of hospitality, also of respect and, in certain relationships, of humility.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 13:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> Ge 24:32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/40/2\" data-bid=\"41-3\" class=\"b\"> 43:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/40/3\" data-bid=\"41-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Ti 5:10</a>.<strong>Agreement, Sharing Together. </strong><em>Handshaking </em>and <em>striking the palms </em>of the hands were gestures employed to express agreement, ratification, or confirmation of a contract or bargain.

Then the one blessing would put his hands on the head of the one being blessed.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 47:29-31</a>) The word &#x201C;thigh&#x201D; applies to the upper part of the leg from the hip to the knee, in which the femur is located. According to the Jewish rabbi Rashbam, this method of swearing was used when a superior adjured an inferior, such as a master his servant or a father his son, who also owes him obedience. And according to another Jewish scholar, Abraham Ibn Ezra, it was the custom in those days for a servant to take an oath in this manner, placing his hand under his master&#x2019;s thigh, the latter sitting upon his hand. This signified that the servant was under his master&#x2019;s authority.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Soncino Chumash, </em>edited by A.&#xA0;Cohen, London, 1956, p.&#xA0;122.<strong>Grief, Shame. </strong><em>Throwing dust on the head; ripping garments; wearing sackcloth. </em>Grief was usually accompanied by weeping (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 50:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/50/1\" data-bid=\"51-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 11:35</a>), often by bowing the head sadly (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 58:5</a>), by throwing dust on one&#x2019;s head (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 7:6</a>), or by sitting on the ground (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Job 2:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/53/1\" data-bid=\"54-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 3:26</a>).
