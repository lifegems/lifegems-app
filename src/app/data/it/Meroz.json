(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003005/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 5:5-16</a>) Or, if Meroz lay on defeated Sisera&#x2019;s escape route, perhaps its inhabitants failed to detain him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003005/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:17</a>) The fact that the Bible account next relates Jael&#x2019;s courageous act in killing Sisera lends some support to the latter view. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003005/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 5:24-27</a>) The angel pronouncing the curse possibly was one who fought for Israel.Meroz&#x2019; exact location is unknown, although some tentatively place it at Khirbet Marus, about 8&#xA0;km (5&#xA0;mi) S of Kedesh in Naphtali."}
