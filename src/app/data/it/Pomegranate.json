Within the hard rind it is crowded with small capsules full of juice, each containing a small pink or red seed.The pomegranate tree (<em>Punica granatum</em>), also denoted by the Hebrew word <em>rim&#xB7;mohn&#x2B9;, </em>grows throughout the Middle East. It seldom passes 4.5&#xA0;m (15&#xA0;ft) in height. The spreading branches are numerous and have dark-green leaves that are shaped like the head of a lance and that produce blossoms with coral-red to scarlet flowers.<wbr>&#x2014;PICTURE, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;742.Pomegranate juice makes a refreshing drink (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003519/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 8:2</a>), a syrup called grenadine is produced from the seeds, and the blossoms are used in the preparation of an astringent medicine used as a remedy for dysentery.
