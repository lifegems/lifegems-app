He may or may not have religious connections with the natives of the land in which he resides. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants were referred to as such before they were given legal title to the Promised Land.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 15:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 17:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> De 23:7</a>.When the Bible refers to a person of non-Israelite origin in relation to the Israelite commonwealth, the designation &#x201C;alien resident&#x201D; sometimes applies to one of these who had become a proselyte or a full worshiper of Jehovah. At times it refers to a settler in the land of Palestine who was content to live among the Israelites, obeying the fundamental laws of the land but not fully accepting the worship of Jehovah. The context determines to which class the term applies.The Greek <em>Septuagint </em>translates <em>ger </em>as proselyte (Gr., <em>pro&#xB7;se&#x2B9;ly&#xB7;tos</em>) more than 70 times. Some suggest that often the alien resident attached himself to a Hebrew household for protection and was somewhat of a dependent but still distinguished from a slave. This is inferred from the expression &#x201C;your alien resident.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">De 5:14</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">De 1:16</a>; also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Le 22:10</a>, where the term <em>toh&#xB7;shav&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;settler,&#x201D; is used.When the Law covenant was transmitted at Mount Sinai, special legislation was embodied governing, in a very loving spirit, the relationship of the alien resident to the natural Israelite. Being at a disadvantage because of not being a natural-born Israelite, the alien resident was given special consideration and protection under the Law covenant, which had many provisions for the weak and vulnerable. Regularly Jehovah called Israel&#x2019;s attention to the fact that they themselves knew the afflictions that beset an alien resident in a land not his own and hence should extend to the alien residents among themselves the generous and protective spirit that they had not received.

Then, in the time of Cornelius (36&#xA0;C.E.), an uncircumcised Gentile and his household were accepted by Jehovah, receiving gifts of the spirit.

The Hebrew word for settler (<em>toh&#xB7;shav&#x2B9;</em>) comes from the root verb <em>ya&#xB7;shav&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;dwell.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 20:15</a>) Evidently some of the settlers in Israel became proselytes; others were content to dwell with the Israelites and to obey the fundamental laws of the land but did not become worshipers of Jehovah as did circumcised proselytes. The settler was distinguished from the foreigner, who was generally a transient and was only extended the hospitality that is usually accorded guests in the Orient.The settler who was an uncircumcised dweller in the land did not eat of the Passover or of anything holy.

According to the context &#x201C;stranger,&#x201D; in most occurrences in the Pentateuch, refers to anyone not of the family of Aaron or not of the tribe of Levi, because priestly or ministerial privileges and duties were not assigned to him.The stranger (non-Aaronite) could not eat of the installation sacrifice (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 29:33</a>), nor be anointed with holy anointing oil (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:33</a>), nor eat anything holy (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000195/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">Le 22:10</a>). A non-Aaronite stranger could not handle any priestly duties.
