Adam, and later his descendants, had to contend with troublesome thistles when cultivating the cursed ground. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004384/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:17,&#xA0;18</a>) Since their seeds are scattered by the wind, thistles readily gain a foothold in neglected and desolated areas. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004384/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 10:8</a>.) Jesus Christ referred to thistles in illustrating that people, just like plants, are recognized by their fruits. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004384/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:16</a>) In Palestine it is not uncommon to see a number of star thistles being driven along as a rolling mass by fall winds, a feature perhaps alluded to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004384/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 83:13</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004384/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 17:13</a>."}
