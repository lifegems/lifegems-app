Atad may have been a person, but the name itself appears to designate a location. The funeral party included Pharaoh&#x2019;s servants as well as the older men of Egypt, and when the Canaanites saw the mourning rites, they exclaimed: &#x201C;This is a heavy mourning for the Egyptians!&#x201D; Hence, the place was called Abel-mizraim, meaning &#x201C;Mourning of the Egyptians.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000450/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 50:7-13</a>.Various translations (for example, <em>AS, AT, RS</em>) use &#x201C;beyond the Jordan&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000450/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 50:10, 11</a>, and some conclude that the threshing floor of Atad was situated E of the Jordan River. This would mean that the procession took, not a direct, but a circuitous route, around the Dead Sea, which it could have done in order to avoid contact with the Philistines. However, the Hebrew expression <em>be&#x2BD;e&#x2B9;ver, </em>translated &#x201C;beyond,&#x201D; can refer to a region either E or W of the Jordan. From Moses&#x2019; viewpoint in the land of Moab at the time of the completion of the Pentateuch, &#x201C;beyond the Jordan&#x201D; could mean W of the river. Yet, all difficulties are overcome by the <em>New World Translation, </em>which accurately renders the Hebrew text &#x201C;in the region of the Jordan&#x201D; in these verses."}
