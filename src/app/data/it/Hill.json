Rounded hills are especially noticeable in Judea, though they are also found in other parts of Palestine.<span id=\"page1119\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1119\" data-before-text=\"1119\"></span>On occasion hills served as burial places and places for concealment.

In a figurative sense, the hills were leveled in making possible the unhindered return of the Jews from Babylon to Jerusalem in 537&#xA0;B.C.E. This was also prophetic of the preparatory work done by John the Baptizer before the appearance of the Messiah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002027/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 40:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002027/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 3:1-6</a>.It was often on hills that the Israelites, in imitation of the Canaanites, carried on idolatrous worship.
