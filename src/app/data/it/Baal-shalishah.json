(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000520/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 4:42-44</a>) It was a time of famine, and Elisha was at Gilgal.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000520/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 9:4</a>) There is a reference to Baal-shalishah in the Babylonian Talmud describing it as a place where the fruits ripened especially early. (<em>Sanhedrin </em>12<em>a</em>) A suggested location is that of Kafr Thulth in the foothills of Ephraim, the name Thulth being the precise equivalent in Arabic of the Hebrew Shalishah. Kafr Thulth is located about 46&#xA0;km (29&#xA0;mi) NNW of Jerusalem."}
