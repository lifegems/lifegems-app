Anciently, livestock often figured in barter, that is, the exchange of one item for another and evidently the oldest method of making a business transaction. Indicative of this is the fact that the Latin word for money (<em>pecunia</em>) is drawn from <em>pecus, </em>meaning &#x201C;cattle.&#x201D; However, livestock (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003106/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 47:17</a>) and foodstuffs (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003106/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 5:10,&#xA0;11</a>) were not always convenient mediums of exchange. Therefore metals such as gold and silver came to be used. As early as Abraham&#x2019;s time, precious metals served as money. But this was not standard coined money. It consisted of silver and gold, doubtless molded for convenience into bars, rings, bracelets, or other standard shapes having a specific weight.

The Bible, however, provides some indication of purchasing power and this is helpful in understanding ancient values. In the time of Jesus&#x2019; earthly ministry, agricultural laborers commonly received a denarius for a 12-hour workday. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003106/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 20:2</a>) It may be assumed that in the Hebrew Scripture period wages were about the same. If so, a silver shekel would be the equivalent of three days&#x2019; wages.The price of a slave was 30 silver shekels (perhaps 90 days&#x2019; wages). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003106/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:32</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003106/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Le 27:2-7</a>.) Hosea the prophet purchased a woman for 15 silver pieces and one and a half homers (15 ephahs) of barley. Likely this payment constituted the full price for a slave.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003106/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 17:24</a>) As a drachma was the equivalent of about a day&#x2019;s wages, a woman might reasonably sweep her whole house and diligently search for a lost drachma coin.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003106/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 15:8,&#xA0;9</a>.Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver, evidently the price of a slave.

But the kind of coin is not specified in the account, except for their being silver.<strong>Money Can Be Both Beneficial and Harmful. </strong>Money provides a defense against poverty and its attendant troubles, enabling persons to procure both necessities and luxuries.
