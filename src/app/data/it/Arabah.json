It varies in width from less than 1&#xA0;km to 16&#xA0;km (0.5 to 10&#xA0;mi) and is 435&#xA0;km (270&#xA0;mi) long, owing its existence to a fault line, or <span id=\"page139\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"139\" data-before-text=\"139\"></span>long fracture in the earth&#x2019;s crust. The Jordan winds through the northern part of this straight valley, and its steady flow waters a green belt down the center of the valley&#x2019;s floor. South of the Dead Sea, however, the Arabah is fed only by seasonal torrent streams that are insufficient to bring life to the dry soil.Some commentators limit the word &#x201C;Arabah&#x201D; to the part of this great rift valley that is S of the Dead Sea, but it also refers to the region at least as far N as the Sea of Galilee, or Chinnereth.
