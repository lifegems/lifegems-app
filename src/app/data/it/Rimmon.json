The Syrian army chief Naaman, after being cured of his leprosy, acknowledged Jehovah as the true God but expressed concern over his having to accompany the king of Syria into the temple of Rimmon and there bow down with the king before the idol of Rimmon, as the king would be leaning upon Naaman&#x2019;s arm.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003734/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 5:15-18</a>.Rimmon is generally identified with Ramman (meaning &#x201C;Roarer, Thunderer&#x201D;), a god known to <span id=\"page812\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"812\" data-before-text=\"812\"></span>have been venerated in Assyria and Babylonia. It has been suggested that the worship of Rimmon (Ramman) was brought westward from Assyria by some of the tribes that later settled around Damascus. A number of scholars regard Rimmon (Ramman) as but a title of the storm-god Hadad (Adad). The fact that Tab<em>rimmon </em>and Ben-<em>hadad </em>were names of Syrian kings suggests a basis for equating Rimmon with Hadad, since these kings likely bore the name or title of their chief god.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003734/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 15:18</a>.The Rimmon venerated in Syria undoubtedly had much in common with Ramman. To the Assyrians, the latter was primarily a god of storm and thunder. Although regarded as the giver of rain and hence the provider of water for wells and fields, Ramman is associated more prominently with the destructive aspects of rain and lightning. On the Assyrian monuments Ramman is portrayed repeatedly as a god of war. He was regarded as such also in Babylonia, where Ramman, the moon-god Sin, and the sun-god Shamash constituted one of numerous triads."}
