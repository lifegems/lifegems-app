Since the strength and permanence of a building depend largely on the strength of its foundation, great care must be exercised in laying the foundation. Good foundations were vital in Palestine to withstand not only heavy rains, winds, and floods but also earthquakes, as this region is an earthquake area. A number of Hebrew terms rendered &#x201C;foundation&#x201D; come from the root <em>ya&#xB7;sadh&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;found; lay the foundation; solidly fix.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 23:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 51:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Ps 24:2</a>) The Greek term is <em>the&#xB7;me&#x2B9;li&#xB7;os, </em>used in a literal sense in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 16:26</a>.The Master Builder Jehovah, in answering Job out of the windstorm, compared the literal earth to a building.

At the &#x2018;founding of the earth&#x2019; the angels shouted in applause. Also, great rejoicing attended the laying of the foundation of Zerubbabel&#x2019;s temple, although those who had seen the glory of the former temple gave way to weeping.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 38:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 6,&#xA0;7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> Ezr 3:10-13</a>.As Solomon had used large, costly hewn stones for the foundation of the temple, so a foundation that is precious to God is laid for the &#x201C;spiritual house&#x201D; in which Jesus&#x2019; anointed followers are &#x201C;living stones.&#x201D; Jesus himself is the foundation cornerstone; upon the foundation of the apostles and Christian prophets the rest of the holy ones are built up into &#x201C;a place for God to inhabit by spirit.&#x201D; All the &#x201C;stones&#x201D; making up this spiritual house are selected by Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 2:4-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Eph 2:19-22</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001558/2\">CORNERSTONE</a>.Most appropriately, the 12 symbolic foundation stones of the New Jerusalem, bearing the names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb, are precious stones.
