Knives used in Biblical lands in times past were made of stone (particularly of flint), copper, bronze, or iron.The Hebrew term <em>ma&#xB7;&#x2BC;akhe&#x2B9;leth, </em>which literally refers to an instrument for eating, is also applied to large knives such as those employed in cutting up the carcasses of sacrificial animals. A &#x201C;slaughtering knife&#x201D; (Heb., <em>ma&#xB7;&#x2BC;akhe&#x2B9;leth</em>) was the instrument faithful Abraham took in hand when about to sacrifice Isaac (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002641/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002641/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;10</a>), and the same type was used by a certain Levite to cut the body of his dead concubine into 12 pieces. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002641/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 19:29</a>) Also, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002641/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 30:14</a> speaks of &#x201C;a generation whose teeth are swords and whose jawbones are slaughtering knives,&#x201D; thus employing the same Hebrew term as a figure of rapaciousness.&#x201C;Flint knives&#x201D; were made by Joshua for use in circumcising the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002641/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 5:2-4</a>) Part of the Hebrew term designating these knives is <em>che&#x2B9;rev, </em>generally rendered &#x201C;sword.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002641/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 5:2</a>, ftn.) The common &#x201C;Canaanite&#x201D; flint knife was about 15&#xA0;cm (6&#xA0;in.) in length and had a raised center ridge and a double edge.Scribes and secretaries of ancient times used a type of knife to sharpen their reed pens and to make erasures. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002641/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 36:23</a> tells of the use of a &#x201C;secretary&#x2019;s knife&#x201D; to tear apart a roll of a book prepared by Jeremiah at Jehovah&#x2019;s direction.Many ancient knives of copper have a straight blade from 15 to 25&#xA0;cm (6 to 10&#xA0;in.) in length; some with curved tips have also been discovered. Handles were often one piece with the blade. Other handles were made of wood and were fastened to the blade.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002641/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 23:1, 2</a> makes figurative reference to a knife, recommending the &#x2018;putting of a knife to one&#x2019;s throat&#x2019; when eating with a king, evidently emphasizing the need to restrain one&#x2019;s appetite in such a circumstance."}
