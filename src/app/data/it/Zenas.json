Paul says that Zenas was &#x201C;versed in the [Mosaic] Law,&#x201D; which may mean that he was either a Jew or a Jewish proselyte who had been converted to Christianity. His Greek name might favor the latter conclusion, but this is by no means decisive, since in the first century C.E., it was not uncommon for Jews to have Greek or Roman names. Other such examples include Justus, Dorcas, and Mark.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004695/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004695/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 9:36;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004695/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 12:25</a>."}
