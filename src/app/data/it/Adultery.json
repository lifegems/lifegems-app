The Hebrew root meaning &#x201C;commit adultery&#x201D; is <em>na&#xB7;&#x2BC;aph&#x2B9;, </em>while its Greek counterpart is <em>moi&#xB7;kheu&#x2B9;o.<wbr></em>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 16:32</a>, ftn; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:32</a>, ftn.Certain primitive societies allow free relations within the same tribe, but promiscuity outside tribal bounds is considered adultery. On the history of adultery, <em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend </em>(1949, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;15) says: &#x201C;It occurs in all parts of the world and though it is considered reprehensible by many cultures it has enjoyed a considerable popularity in all cultures and at all times.&#x201D; Monuments attest to its prevalence in ancient Egypt; Potiphar&#x2019;s wife, who proposed that Joseph have relations with her, was such an Egyptian.

The seventh commandment of the Decalogue stated in direct, unmistakable language: &#x201C;You must not commit adultery.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 20:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> De 5:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 18:20</a>) Adulterous invasion of another man&#x2019;s domain was prohibited, as were other forms of sexual misconduct.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/0\">FORNICATION</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/1\">PROSTITUTE</a>.Under the Law of Moses the penalty for adultery was severe<wbr>&#x2014;death for both guilty parties: &#x201C;In case a man is found lying down with a woman owned by an owner, both of them must then die together.&#x201D; This applied even to a betrothed woman, it being considered that she had committed adultery if she had relations with a man other than the one to whom she was duly engaged.

He broadened out the matter of adultery, saying it was not limited to sexual contact a man might have with a woman not his mate: &#x201C;Everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&#x201D; Such men are among those who &#x201C;have eyes full of adultery.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:27, 28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Pe 2:14</a>.Jesus also pointed out that if a divorce was obtained by either husband or wife, except on the ground of fornication (Gr., <em>por&#xB7;nei&#x2B9;a</em>), the remarriage of either one would constitute adultery. Even <span id=\"page54\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"54\" data-before-text=\"54\"></span>a single man who took such a divorced woman as his wife would be guilty of adultery.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> Mr 10:11, 12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/8/3\" data-bid=\"9-4\" class=\"b\"> Lu 16:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/8/4\" data-bid=\"9-5\" class=\"b\"> Ro 7:2,&#xA0;3</a>.Adultery is &#x201C;actually sin against God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 39:9</a>) Jehovah will judge those guilty of adultery, and none who persist in such a course &#x201C;will inherit God&#x2019;s kingdom.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Mal 3:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 6:9, 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 13:4</a>) How true the proverb: &#x201C;Anyone committing adultery with a woman is in want of heart; he that does it is bringing his own soul to ruin.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000123/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 6:32-35</a>.<strong><em>How could one become guilty of spiritual adultery?</em></strong>In a spiritual sense, adultery denotes unfaithfulness to Jehovah on the part of those who are joined to him in a covenant. Natural Israel in the Law covenant was, therefore, guilty of spiritual adultery because of false religious practices, some of which included sex-worship rites and disregard for the seventh commandment.
