(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:3</a>) Its exact position is uncertain, but it is generally identified with Khirbet el-Muqanna&#x2BD; (Tel Miqne), about 18&#xA0;km (11&#xA0;mi) E of Ashdod. Recent excavation there has unearthed the largest city of its period and gives it current preference as the site of Ekron.Ekron&#x2019;s history is one of constantly changing domination. Joshua&#x2019;s conquest did not include <span id=\"page701\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"701\" data-before-text=\"701\"></span>Ekron. It was not until later that the Judeans captured it. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:18</a>) In the initial division of the Promised Land, Ekron was on the border between Judah and Dan but within the tribe of Judah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 45, 46;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 19:40-43</a>) By the time the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, Ekron was back in their possession. The presence of the Ark caused &#x201C;a death-dealing confusion&#x201D; to break out in this city, and it was from Ekron that the Ark was finally sent back to the Jews. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 5:10-12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 6:16,&#xA0;17</a>) After another period under Israelite control, the Philistines apparently again had Ekron at the time David slew Goliath. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 7:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001270/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 17:52</a>) It was in the early tenth century B.C.E. that Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt claimed to have taken Ekron. Some two centuries later, according to Sennacherib&#x2019;s annals, Ekron&#x2019;s King Padi was loyal to the Assyrians."}
