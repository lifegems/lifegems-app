Waterless even in winter, except in case of an especially heavy rain, the Kidron Valley (Nahal Qidron) starts some distance to the N of Jerusalem&#x2019;s walls. At first a broad and shallow valley, it continues to narrow and deepen. By the time it is opposite the former temple area, it is approximately 30&#xA0;m (100&#xA0;ft) deep and 120&#xA0;m (390&#xA0;ft) wide. Farther to the S the Kidron Valley was joined by the Tyropoeon Valley and the Valley of Hinnom respectively. From then on it continued southeastward across the arid Wilderness of Judah to the Dead Sea. The modern name applied to the valley&#x2019;s lower course is Wadi en-Nar (meaning &#x201C;Fire Wadi&#x201D;), indicating that it is hot and dry most of the time.Opposite Jerusalem, rock-cut tombs occupy the steep and rocky slopes of the valley&#x2019;s E side. On its W side, about midway between the former temple area and the junction of the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys, is the spring of Gihon. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002606/0\">GIHON</a> No.&#xA0;2.) Not far from this spring the Kidron Valley widens and forms an open space. It has been suggested that this open area may correspond to the ancient &#x201C;king&#x2019;s garden.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002606/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 25:4</a>.King David, when fleeing from rebellious Absalom, crossed the Kidron Valley on foot.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002606/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 2:8, 9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002606/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 36,&#xA0;37</a>) It was this same valley that Jesus traversed on his way to the garden of Gethsemane. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002606/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 18:1</a>) During the reigns of Judean Kings Asa, Hezekiah, and Josiah, the Kidron Valley was used as a place of disposal for appendages of idolatry.
