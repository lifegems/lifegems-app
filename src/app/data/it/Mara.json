Naomi had left Bethlehem with a husband and two sons (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002896/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ru 1:1,&#xA0;2</a>), but returned from Moab as a saddened, childless widow. At that time her old friends, the women of Bethlehem, asked: &#x201C;Is this Naomi?&#x201D; Still grief stricken, she replied: &#x201C;Do not call me Naomi [meaning &#x201C;My Pleasantness&#x201D;]. Call me Mara [meaning &#x201C;Bitter&#x201D;], for the Almighty has made it very bitter for me. I was full when I went, and it is empty-handed that Jehovah has made me return.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002896/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ru 1:19-21</a>."}
