(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001218/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 15:8,&#xA0;9</a>) The Attic drachma bore the head of the goddess Athena on one side and an owl on the other side. By the time of Jesus&#x2019; earthly ministry, the drachma probably had depreciated to about 3.4&#xA0;g (0.109&#xA0;oz t) and hence would be presently evaluated at 65&#xA0;cents. In the first century C.E. the Greeks equated the drachma with the denarius, but the Roman government officially reckoned the value of the drachma at three fourths of a denarius. The Jews paid an annual temple tax of two drachmas (a didrachma).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001218/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 17:24</a>.The Greek silver drachma is not to be confused with the gold &#x201C;drachma&#x201D; (<em>dar&#xB7;kemohn&#x2B9;</em>) of the Hebrew Scriptures, a coin generally equated with the Persian daric (8.4&#xA0;g; 0.27&#xA0;oz t; $94.50 according to modern values).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001218/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 2:69;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001218/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Ne 7:70-72</a>."}
