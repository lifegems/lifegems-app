It is the opposite of foolishness, stupidity, and madness, with which it is often contrasted.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 32:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 11:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Ec 6:8</a>.The basic terms signifying wisdom are the Hebrew <em>chokh&#xB7;mah&#x2B9; </em>(verb, <em>cha&#xB7;kham&#x2B9;</em>) and the Greek <em>so&#xB7;phi&#x2B9;a, </em>with their related forms. Also, there are the Hebrew <em>tu&#xB7;shi&#xB7;yah&#x2B9;, </em>which may be rendered &#x201C;effectual working&#x201D; or &#x201C;practical wisdom,&#x201D; and the Greek <em>phro&#x2B9;ni&#xB7;mos </em>and <em>phro&#x2B9;ne&#xB7;sis </em>(from <em>phren, </em>the &#x201C;mind&#x201D;), relating to &#x201C;sensibleness,&#x201D; &#x201C;discretion,&#x201D; or &#x201C;practical wisdom.&#x201D;Wisdom implies a <em>breadth </em>of knowledge and a <em>depth </em>of understanding, these giving the soundness and clarity of judgment characteristic of wisdom. The wise man &#x2018;treasures up knowledge,&#x2019; has a fund of it to draw upon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 10:14</a>) While &#x201C;wisdom is the prime thing,&#x201D; the counsel is that &#x201C;with all that you acquire, acquire understanding.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 4:5-7</a>) Understanding (a broad term that frequently embraces discernment) adds strength to wisdom, contributing greatly to discretion and foresight, also notable characteristics of wisdom. <span id=\"page1190\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1190\" data-before-text=\"1190\"></span>Discretion implies prudence and may be expressed in caution, self-control, moderation, or restraint. The &#x201C;discreet [form of <em>phro&#x2B9;ni&#xB7;mos</em>] man&#x201D; builds his house on a rock-mass, foreseeing the possibility of storm; the foolish man builds his on sand and suffers disaster.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:24-27</a>.Understanding fortifies wisdom in other ways. For example, a person may obey a certain command of God because he recognizes the rightness of such obedience, and this is wisdom on his part. But if he gets real understanding of the <em>reason </em>for that command, the good purpose it serves, and the benefits accruing from it, his heart determination to continue in that wise course is greatly strengthened.

These accounts and related texts show that wisdom is indeed a blend of many things: knowledge, <span id=\"page1191\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1191\" data-before-text=\"1191\"></span>understanding (which includes discernment), thinking ability, experience, diligence, shrewdness (the opposite of being gullible or naive [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 14:15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;18</a>]), and right judgment.

Wisdom on a limited scale is attainable by man through his own efforts, though he must in any case use the intelligence with which God (who even gave the animals certain instinctive wisdom [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Job 35:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/28/1\" data-bid=\"29-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 30:24-28</a>]) initially endowed man. Man learns from observation of, and working with, the materials of God&#x2019;s creation. Such wisdom may vary in type and extent. The Greek word <em>so&#xB7;phi&#x2B9;a </em>is often applied to skill in a certain trade or craft, to skill and sound administrative judgment in governmental and business fields, or to extensive knowledge in some particular field of human science or research. Similarly, the Hebrew <em>chokh&#xB7;mah&#x2B9; </em>and <em>cha&#xB7;kham&#x2B9; </em>are used to describe the &#x2018;skillfulness&#x2019; of sailors and ship caulkers (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:8,&#xA0;9</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 107:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/30/1\" data-bid=\"31-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;27</a>) and of workers in stone and wood (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004618/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 22:15</a>), as well as the wisdom and skill of other craftsmen, some having great talent in a wide variety of crafts.
