Asshur was a sort of &#x201C;deified patriarch,&#x201D; and in venerating him, the Assyrians may actually have worshiped their ancestor, Asshur, the son of Shem. The name Asshur is incorporated in many Assyrian names, such as those of Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal.The false god Asshur was believed to be the chief protector of the Assyrians, being represented in their art by the winged sun disk. It was in their god Asshur&#x2019;s name and with his approval (indicated by favorable omens) that Assyrian troops entered battle, carrying his sacred symbol into the fray. Their kings ascribed victories &#x201C;to the help of Asshur.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;See PICTURE, Vol.&#xA0;2, p.&#xA0;529; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000442/0\">ASSYRIA</a>."}
