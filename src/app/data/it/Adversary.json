The Hebrew word for &#x201C;adversary&#x201D; (<em>tsar</em>) comes from a root meaning &#x201C;harass; show hostility to.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 25:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 129:1</a>) The Greek word <em>an&#xB7;ti&#x2B9;di&#xB7;kos </em>primarily refers to an &#x201C;adversary at law&#x201D; in a legal case (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 12:58;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:3</a>), but it can refer to others who are adversaries, or enemies, as in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Peter 5:8</a>.The most wicked Adversary, Satan the Devil, caused men and angels (see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/0\">DEMON</a>) to join his opposition to God and man. Satan first showed his opposition in the garden of Eden, where, through cruel and underhanded action, he led Eve and then Adam into a course of rebellion that brought sin and death upon all mankind. In the courts of heaven Satan displayed his antagonism, charging Jehovah with bribing Job for his loyalty, a charge which became an issue of universal importance.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:6-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:1-5</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/1\">SATAN</a>.Worshipers of Jehovah in all ages have endured similar opposition from the Adversary by means of his agents. For example, when the remnant of God&#x2019;s people returned from Babylon, there were those who tried to prevent rebuilding the temple and the city wall.

Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. But take your stand against him, solid in the faith.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 5:8,&#xA0;9</a>) Eventually Jehovah&#x2019;s power will triumph over all opposers.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 30:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000125/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Mic 5:9</a>.When God&#x2019;s people were unfaithful he allowed their adversaries to plunder and defeat them.
