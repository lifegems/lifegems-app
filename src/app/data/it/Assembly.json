In these ways he acts for their benefit. Assemblies of God&#x2019;s people of ancient times varied as to purpose. Yet they surely contributed to unity, for all in attendance had the opportunity to hear the same things at the same time. Such gatherings resulted in many spiritual benefits and were often occasions of great joy.<strong>Hebrew and Greek Terms. </strong>Several Hebrew and Greek words are employed in the Bible to denote a gathering. One that is common in the Hebrew text is <em>&#x2BD;e&#xB7;dhah&#x2B9;. </em>It is from the root <em>ya&#xB7;&#x2BD;adh&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;appoint; designate,&#x201D; and thus indicates a group assembled by appointment.

Eventually these were established in various places, large cities having more than one. Primarily, synagogues were schools where the Scriptures were read and taught. They were also places of prayer and for the giving of praise to God. It was customary for Jesus Christ and his disciples to go to them to instruct and encourage persons present. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/52/1\" data-bid=\"53-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 4:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/52/2\" data-bid=\"53-3\" class=\"b\"> Ac 13:14, 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/52/3\" data-bid=\"53-4\" class=\"b\"> 17:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/52/4\" data-bid=\"53-5\" class=\"b\"> 18:4</a>) Because the Scriptures were regularly read in the synagogues, James was able to say to the Christian governing body in Jerusalem: &#x201C;From ancient times Moses has had in city after city those who preach him, because he is read aloud in the synagogues on every sabbath.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 15:21</a>) The basic features of worship in the synagogue were carried over into Christian assembly places, where Scripture reading and exposition, encouragement, prayer, and the giving of praise were to be found.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 14:26-33,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/54/1\" data-bid=\"55-2\" class=\"b\"> 40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/54/2\" data-bid=\"55-3\" class=\"b\"> Col 4:16</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/1\">SYNAGOGUE</a>.<span id=\"page199\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"199\" data-before-text=\"199\"></span><strong>Christian Assemblies. </strong>On various occasions, large crowds assembled before Jesus Christ, realizing many benefits, as in the case of the Sermon on the Mount. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:1&#x2013;7:29</a>) While these were not like specially arranged assemblies, at times they lasted long enough to make necessary the feeding of the congregated multitudes, a circumstance that Jesus met with the miraculous multiplication of food. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 14:14-21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/56/1\" data-bid=\"57-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:29-38</a>) Often Christ gathered his disciples and gave them spiritual instruction, and after his death his followers met together, as on the day of Pentecost 33&#xA0;C.E., when the holy spirit was bestowed upon such assembled ones.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:1-4</a>.It was the custom of early Christians to meet together, generally in small groups. However, sometimes at their gatherings &#x201C;quite a crowd&#x201D; would assemble. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 11:26</a>) Jesus&#x2019; half brother James found it appropriate to give spiritual Israelites counsel against showing favoritism toward the rich at a public gathering (Gr., <em>sy&#xB7;na&#xB7;go&#xB7;ge&#x2B9;</em>) of the congregation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 2:1-9</a>.<strong>Importance of Assembling. </strong>The importance of taking full advantage of Jehovah&#x2019;s provisions for assembling to gain spiritual benefits is emphasized in connection with the annual Passover observance. Any male who was clean and was not on a journey but who neglected to keep the Passover was to be cut off in death. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 9:9-14</a>) When King Hezekiah called inhabitants of Judah and Israel to Jerusalem for a Passover celebration, his message was, in part: &#x201C;You sons of Israel, return to Jehovah .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. do not stiffen your neck as your forefathers did. Give place to Jehovah and come to his sanctuary that he has sanctified to time indefinite and serve Jehovah your God, that his burning anger may turn back from you. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and he will not turn away the face from you if you return to him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 30:6-9</a>) Willful failure to attend would certainly have indicated a forsaking of God. And, while such festivals as the Passover are not observed by Christians, Paul fittingly urged them not to abandon regular assemblies of God&#x2019;s people, stating: &#x201C;Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:24, 25</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000441/2\">CONGREGATION</a>."}
