(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001597/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 31:43-48</a>) The later name of this region, &#x201C;Gilead,&#x201D; was probably drawn from &#x201C;Galeed,&#x201D; the name originally given to the spot where this event occurred about 1761&#xA0;B.C.E.In obedience to divine direction, and without giving notice, Jacob left Paddan-aram and the service of Laban, who was both his uncle and his <span id=\"page883\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"883\" data-before-text=\"883\"></span>father-in-law. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001597/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 28:2</a>) With all his belongings, and with his wives and children, Jacob crossed the Euphrates River and headed for the land of Canaan. After three days Laban, accompanied by his &#x201C;brothers,&#x201D; went in pursuit for the distance of a seven days&#x2019; journey, finally overtaking Jacob&#x2019;s caravan in the mountains of Gilead N of the torrent valley of Jabbok.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001597/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 31:17-25</a>.Peaceably settling the points over which they had disputed, Jacob and Laban concluded a covenant with each other. In this connection, Jacob set up a stone pillar and directed his &#x201C;brothers&#x201D; to make a heap of stones, perhaps in the form of a table, upon which the covenant meal was eaten. Thereupon, Laban called the place after this heap, giving it the Aramaic (Syrian) name &#x201C;Jegar-sahadutha,&#x201D; but which Jacob called &#x201C;Galeed,&#x201D; the Hebrew equivalent. Laban said: &#x201C;This heap [Heb., <em>gal</em>] is a witness [Heb., <em>&#x2BD;edh</em>] between me and you today.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001597/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 31:44-48</a>) The heap of stones (and the stone pillar) served as a witness to all passersby. It was as <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001597/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">verse 49</a> says, &#x201C;The Watchtower [Heb., <em>mits&#xB7;pah&#x2B9;</em>],&#x201D; testifying that Jacob and Laban had agreed to preserve the peace between and within their respective families. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001597/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 31:50-53</a>) On later occasions stones were used in a similar fashion as silent witnesses.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001597/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 4:4-7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001597/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 24:25-27</a>."}
