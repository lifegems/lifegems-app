Enoch was born in the land of Fugitiveness after Cain had killed his brother Abel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001371/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 4:17,&#xA0;18</a>.<strong>2. </strong>The son born to Jared at the age of 162; the seventh man in the genealogical line from Adam. In addition to Methuselah, who was born to him when he was 65 years old, Enoch had other sons and daughters. Enoch was one of the &#x201C;so great a cloud of witnesses&#x201D; who were outstanding examples of faith in ancient times. &#x201C;Enoch kept walking with the true God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001371/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 5:18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001371/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 21-24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001371/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 11:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001371/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> 12:1</a>) As a prophet of Jehovah, he foretold God&#x2019;s coming with His holy myriads to execute judgment against the ungodly. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001371/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jude&#xA0;14,&#xA0;15</a>) Likely persecution was brought against him because of his prophesying. However, God did not permit the opposers to kill Enoch. Instead, Jehovah &#x201C;took him,&#x201D; that is, cut short his life at the age of 365, an age far below that of most of his contemporaries. Enoch was &#x201C;transferred so as not to see death,&#x201D; which may mean that God put him in a prophetic trance and then terminated Enoch&#x2019;s life while he was in the trance so that he did not experience the <em>pangs </em>of death.
