The Greek <em>ke&#xB7;rys&#x2B9;so, </em>which is commonly rendered &#x201C;preach,&#x201D; means, basically, &#x2018;make proclamation as a herald, to be a herald, officiate as herald, proclaim (as conqueror).&#x2019; The related noun is <em>ke&#x2B9;ryx </em>and means &#x2018;herald, public messenger, envoy, crier (who made proclamation and kept order in assemblies, etc.).&#x2019; Another related noun is <em>ke&#x2B9;ryg&#xB7;ma, </em>which means &#x2018;that which is cried by a herald, proclamation, announcement (of victory in games), mandate, summons.&#x2019; (<em>A Greek-English Lexicon, </em>by H.&#xA0;Liddell and R.&#xA0;Scott, revised by H.&#xA0;Jones, Oxford, 1968, p.&#xA0;949) <em>Ke&#xB7;rys&#x2B9;so </em>thus does not convey the thought of the delivery of a sermon to a closed group of disciples but, rather, of an open, public proclamation. This is illustrated by its use to describe the &#x201C;strong angel proclaiming [<em>ke&#xB7;rys&#x2B9;son&#xB7;ta</em>] with a loud voice: &#x2018;Who is worthy to open the scroll and loose its seals?&#x2019;&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Re 5:2</a>; compare also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:27</a>.The word <em>eu&#xB7;ag&#xB7;ge&#xB7;li&#x2B9;zo&#xB7;mai </em>means &#x201C;declare good news.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 11:5</a>) Related words are <em>di&#xB7;ag&#xB7;gel&#x2B9;lo, </em>&#x201C;declare abroad; give notice&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 9:60;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 21:26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Ro 9:17</a>) and <em>ka&#xB7;tag&#xB7;gel&#x2B9;lo, </em>&#x201C;publish; talk about; proclaim; publicize.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 13:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 1:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 11:26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> Col 1:28</a>) The principal difference between <em>ke&#xB7;rys&#x2B9;so </em>and <em>eu&#xB7;ag&#xB7;ge&#xB7;li&#x2B9;zo&#xB7;mai </em>is that the former stresses the <em>manner </em>of the proclamation, that it is a public, authorized pronouncement, and the latter stresses the <em>content </em>thereof, the declaring or bringing of the <em>eu&#xB7;ag&#xB7;ge&#x2B9;li&#xB7;on, </em>the good news or gospel.<em>Ke&#xB7;rys&#x2B9;so </em>corresponds in some measure to the Hebrew <em>ba&#xB7;sar&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;bear news; announce; act as a news bearer.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 4:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 1:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 16:23</a>) <em>Ba&#xB7;sar&#x2B9;, </em>however, does not imply official capacity to the same extent.<strong>Preaching in the Hebrew Scriptures. </strong>Noah is the first person designated as &#x201C;a preacher&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 2:5</a>), although Enoch&#x2019;s earlier prophesying may have been made known by preaching.

The early patriarchs were under no instructions to act as heralds. During the period of the kingdom rule in Israel, prophets did act as public spokesmen proclaiming God&#x2019;s decrees, judgments, and summonses in public places. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 58:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 26:2</a>) Jonah&#x2019;s proclamation to Nineveh fits well the thought conveyed by <em>ke&#x2B9;ryg&#xB7;ma, </em>and it is so described.

The prophets&#x2019; ministry, however, generally was much broader than that of a herald or preacher, and in some cases they employed others to act as their spokesmen.

His teaching receives even greater emphasis than his preaching. Teaching (<em>di&#xB7;da&#x2B9;sko</em>) differs from preaching in that the teacher does more than proclaim; he instructs, explains, shows things by argument, and offers proofs. The work of Jesus&#x2019; disciples, both before and after his death, was thus to be a combination of preaching and teaching.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/27/2\" data-bid=\"28-3\" class=\"b\"> 28:18-20</a>.The theme of Jesus&#x2019; preaching was: &#x2018;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:17</a>) Like an official herald, he was alerting his listeners to his Sovereign God&#x2019;s activity, to a time of opportunity and decision.

Rather, they proclaimed what Jehovah God had done for and through his Son, how God&#x2019;s purposes were being fulfilled and would be fulfilled in Jesus.

However, Paul&#x2019;s exhortation to Timothy to &#x201C;preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season,&#x201D; includes preaching within the congregation, as done by a general overseer. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/73/0\" data-bid=\"74-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 4:2</a>) Paul&#x2019;s letter to Timothy is a pastoral letter, that is, it was directed to one who was doing pastoral work among the Christians and provides counsel on such superintending ministry. Previous to this exhortation to &#x201C;preach the word,&#x201D; Paul warned Timothy of the apostasy beginning to manifest itself, which was to develop to serious proportions.

The only imprisoned spirits referred to in the Scriptures are those angels of Noah&#x2019;s day who were &#x2018;delivered into pits of dense darkness&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/80/0\" data-bid=\"81-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 2:4,&#xA0;5</a>) and &#x201C;reserved with eternal bonds under dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003544/81/0\" data-bid=\"82-1\" class=\"b\">Jude&#xA0;6</a>) Therefore the preaching by the resurrected Jesus to such unrighteous angels could only have been a preaching of judgment. It may be noted that the book of Revelation transmitted in vision to John by Christ Jesus toward the close of the first century C.E. contains much about Satan the Devil and his demons as well as their ultimate destruction, hence, a preaching of judgment.
