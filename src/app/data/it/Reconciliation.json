In Greek, the words related to reconciliation are derived from the verb <em>al&#xB7;las&#x2B9;so, </em>which, basically, means &#x201C;change, alter.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 6:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ga 4:20</a>, <em>Int.</em>Thus, the compound form <em>ka&#xB7;tal&#xB7;las&#x2B9;so, </em>while meaning, basically, &#x201C;exchange,&#x201D; came to have the meaning &#x201C;reconcile.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:10</a>) Paul used this verb when speaking of a woman&#x2019;s &#x2018;making up again&#x2019; with her husband, from whom she had separated. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 7:11</a>) The related <em>di&#xB7;al&#xB7;las&#x2B9;so&#xB7;mai </em>appears at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 5:24</a> in Jesus&#x2019; instructions that a person should first &#x2018;make his peace&#x2019; with his brother before presenting an offering on the altar.<strong>Reconciliation to God. </strong>In Paul&#x2019;s letter to the Romans and in several other letters, he uses <em>ka&#xB7;tal&#xB7;las&#x2B9;so </em>and <em>a&#xB7;po&#xB7;ka&#xB7;tal&#xB7;las&#x2B9;so </em>(an intensified form) in dealing with man&#x2019;s being reconciled to God by means of the sacrifice of Christ Jesus.Such reconciliation to God is necessary because an alienation has existed, a separation, a lack of harmony and of friendly relations, more than that, a state of enmity. This came through the first man Adam&#x2019;s sin and the resultant sinfulness and imperfection inherited by all his descendants. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:12</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 43:27</a>.) The apostle could therefore say that &#x201C;the minding of the flesh means enmity with God, for it is not under subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be [due to its inherited imperfect, sinful nature]. So those who are in harmony with the flesh cannot please God.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:7,&#xA0;8</a>) Enmity exists because God&#x2019;s perfect standards do not allow for his approving or condoning wrongdoing.

He is &#x201C;gracious and merciful&#x201D; and &#x201C;rich in mercy&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 145:8,&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> Eph 2:4</a>); but he does not disregard justice in order to display mercy. As correctly observed in M&#x2019;Clintock and Strong&#x2019;s <em>Cyclop&#xE6;dia </em>(1894, Vol.&#xA0;VIII, p.&#xA0;958), the relation between God and sinful man is thus &#x201C;a legal one, as that of a sovereign, in his judicial capacity, and a criminal who has violated his laws and risen up against his authority, and who is therefore treated as an enemy.&#x201D; This is the situation into which mankind was brought because of the inheritance of sin from their first father, Adam.<strong><em>The basis for reconciliation. </em></strong>It is only by and through the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus that full reconciliation to God is possible; he is &#x201C;the way,&#x201D; and no one comes to the Father except through him.

Rather, that sacrifice appeased, or satisfied, the demands of God&#x2019;s perfect justice by providing the just and righteous basis for pardoning sin, so that God &#x201C;might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man [the hereditarily sinful man] that has faith in Jesus.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 3:24-26</a>) By supplying the means for expiating (making complete satisfaction for) man&#x2019;s sins and unlawful acts, Christ&#x2019;s sacrifice made it <em>propitious </em>(favorable) for man&#x2019;s seeking and receiving a restoration to right relations with the Sovereign God.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 1:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 2:17</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/0\">RANSOM</a>.Thus, through Christ, God made it possible to &#x201C;reconcile again to himself all other things by making peace through the blood he [Jesus] shed on the torture stake,&#x201D; and thereby persons once &#x201C;alienated and enemies&#x201D; because of having their minds on wicked works could now be &#x201C;reconciled by means of that one&#x2019;s fleshly body through his death, in order to present [them] holy and unblemished and open to no accusation before him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Col 1:19-22</a>) Jehovah God could now &#x2018;declare righteous&#x2019; those whom he selected to become his spiritual sons; they would not be subject to any accusation, since they were now persons fully reconciled to, and at peace with, God.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 13:38, 39;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 5:9, 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/17/2\" data-bid=\"18-3\" class=\"b\"> 8:33</a>.What, then, can we say of men who served God in times before Christ&#x2019;s death?

How, then, would such ones need any reconciling by means of Christ&#x2019;s death?These persons obviously enjoyed a measure of reconciliation to God. Nevertheless, they, even as the rest of the world of mankind, were still sinners by inheritance and had acknowledged themselves as such by the animal sacrifices they offered. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 3:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 22, 23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 10:1,&#xA0;2</a>) True, some men have been more overt or gross in their sinning than others, even being openly rebellious; but sin is sin, whatever the degree or extent. Since all are sinners, all men descended from Adam have, without exception, needed the reconciliation with God that his Son&#x2019;s sacrifice made possible.God&#x2019;s relative friendship toward men such as those considered earlier was on the basis of the faith they showed, faith that embraced the belief that God would in his due time provide the means for relieving them completely of their sinful state. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 11:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 39, 40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 1:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/20/3\" data-bid=\"21-4\" class=\"b\"> 8:56;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/20/4\" data-bid=\"21-5\" class=\"b\"> Ac 2:29-31</a>.) Hence, the measure of reconciliation they enjoyed was contingent upon God&#x2019;s future provision of the ransom. As shown under the heading <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/1\">DECLARE RIGHTEOUS</a>, God &#x201C;counted,&#x201D; &#x201C;reckoned&#x201D; or credited, their faith as righteousness, and on that basis, with the absolute certainty of his own provision of a ransom in view, Jehovah could provisionally have friendly relations with them without violating his standards of perfect justice.

Nevertheless, the proper demands of his justice must eventually be satisfied, so that the &#x201C;crediting&#x201D; would be covered by actual payment of the required ransom price. All of this exalts the importance of Christ&#x2019;s position in God&#x2019;s arrangement and demonstrates that, apart from Christ Jesus, men have no righteousness that could qualify them for a standing before God.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 64:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 7:18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/23/2\" data-bid=\"24-3\" class=\"b\"> 21-25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/23/3\" data-bid=\"24-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 1:30, 31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/23/4\" data-bid=\"24-5\" class=\"b\"> 1Jo 1:8-10</a>.<strong><em>Steps necessary for attaining reconciliation. </em></strong>Since God is the offended party whose law has been and is being violated, it is man who must become reconciled to God, not God to man.

He did so through his Son. The apostle writes: &#x201C;For, indeed, Christ, while we were yet weak, died for ungodly men at the appointed time. For hardly will anyone die for a righteous man; indeed, for the good man, perhaps, someone even dares to die. But God recommends his own love [<em>a&#xB7;ga&#x2B9;pen</em>] to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, therefore, since we have been declared righteous now by his blood, shall we be saved through him from wrath. For if, when we were enemies, we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only that, but we are also exulting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:6-11</a>) Jesus, who &#x201C;did not know sin,&#x201D; was made to &#x201C;be sin for us,&#x201D; dying as a human sin offering, to relieve persons of the charge and penalty of sin. Relieved of the charge of sin, such ones could thus appear righteous in God&#x2019;s eyes, hence &#x201C;become God&#x2019;s righteousness by means of him [Jesus].&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 5:18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/31/1\" data-bid=\"32-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;21</a>.God additionally displays his mercy and love by sending out ambassadors to sinful mankind.

God sends his Christian ambassadors to men to enable them to learn his terms for reconciliation and to avail themselves of such. As the apostle writes: &#x201C;We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us. As substitutes for Christ we beg: &#x2018;Become reconciled to God.&#x2019;&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003664/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 5:20</a>) Such entreaty does not signify any weakening of God&#x2019;s position nor of his opposition to wrongdoing; it is, instead, a merciful urging to the offenders to seek peace and escape the inevitable consequence of God&#x2019;s righteous anger toward all who persist in going contrary to his holy will, destruction being the certain end of such.
