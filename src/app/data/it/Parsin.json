(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003389/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Da 5:25</a>) It is the plural number of &#x201C;Peres,&#x201D; which means &#x201C;a half shekel,&#x201D; a division of a shekel. In giving the interpretation, Daniel did not use the plural &#x201C;Parsin,&#x201D; but used the singular form (Peres). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003389/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Da 5:28</a>) Perhaps this was because only Belshazzar was present to hear the prophet explain the prophetic message, although it applied to both rulers of the Babylonian Empire, Belshazzar and Nabonidus.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003389/0\">PERES</a>."}
