Construction techniques varied according to the time period, the economic circumstances of the builder, and the available materials. The builders of Babel, for instance, used brick instead of stone, and &#x201C;bitumen served as mortar for them.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 11:3</a>.Many of the Israelites began dwelling in the houses of the dispossessed Canaanites and likely followed similar construction methods for years afterward. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">De 6:10,&#xA0;11</a>) Apparently stone houses were preferred (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 9:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> Am 5:11</a>), as these were more substantial and safer from intruders than those built of mud brick. Robbers could readily gain access to mud houses by simply digging through a wall. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Job 24:16</a>.) However, in the lowlands, where little good-quality limestone and sandstone was available, sun-dried or, sometimes, kiln-baked mud bricks were used for the walls of dwellings. Sycamore, juniper, and, particularly in the better houses, cedar beams and rafters were used.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 1:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 9:10</a>.Archaeologists have excavated the ruins of several kinds of ancient Palestinian dwellings. Often there was an oven in the courtyard and sometimes also a well or a cistern. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 17:18</a>) The ruins of houses that have been found indicate considerable variation in size. One was only about 5&#xA0;m (16&#xA0;ft) square, whereas another measured 32 by 30&#xA0;m (104 by 97&#xA0;ft). Rooms often were from about 3.5 to 4.5&#xA0;m (12 to 15&#xA0;ft) square.Some houses were built atop wide city walls. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 2:15</a>) But preferably they were constructed on a rock-mass (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:24</a>), and generally mud-brick work was not started until two or three rows of stone had first been laid. When a house could not be erected on a rock-mass, often a solid foundation was laid, its depth below ground being equivalent to the height of the stone wall above ground. Some foundations were built with large uncut stones, and the cracks were filled with small rocks; others were constructed of hewn stones. The ruins of one mud-brick house excavated by archaeologists had stonework to a height of over 0.5&#xA0;m (1.5&#xA0;ft); in another the stone construction rose to a height of about 1&#xA0;m (3&#xA0;ft). The walls of some houses were about 1&#xA0;m (3&#xA0;ft) thick. Often a kind of whitewash was applied to the exterior walls (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 13:11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/24/1\" data-bid=\"25-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;15</a>), and mud-brick walls on the street side were sometimes faced with pebbles to protect their surface.Building stones were aligned and bonded with carefully smoothed and fitted cornerstones. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 118:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/25/1\" data-bid=\"26-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 28:16</a>.) A mixture of clay and straw commonly served as mortar. At times this mixture included lime, ashes, pulverized pottery fragments, pounded shells, or limestone. It was applied to the bricks or stones to hold them together, and it was also used as a plaster for interior walls. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Le 14:41,&#xA0;42</a>) In some cases, however, stones were so accurately cut that mortar was not needed.<strong><em>Floors. </em></strong>Floors, including those of the courtyard, consisted of beaten earth or were paved with stone, brick, or lime plaster. A depression in the floor commonly served as a fireplace, but braziers were used to heat the finer homes.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">De 22:8</a>) When a slight slope was given to the roof, this permitted the rain to run off. The roof rested on strong wooden beams laid from wall to wall. Smaller wooden rafters were placed across these beams and, in turn, were covered with branches, reeds, and the like. Next came a layer of earth several inches thick that was coated with a thick plaster of clay or of clay and lime. An opening could easily be dug through such an earthen roof, as was done by men who were endeavoring to get a paralytic into Jesus&#x2019; presence so that he might be healed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 2:4</a>) The beams of the roof often were supported by a row of upright wooden posts resting on stone bases.

This was a pleasant, cool room that often served as a guest room. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 3:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/50/1\" data-bid=\"51-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 17:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/50/2\" data-bid=\"51-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 1:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/50/3\" data-bid=\"51-4\" class=\"b\"> 4:10</a>) Of course, some homes were two-story buildings with a regular upper story. In a large upper chamber, either a roof chamber or a room of an upper story, Jesus celebrated the last Passover with his disciples and instituted the commemoration of the Lord&#x2019;s Evening Meal. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 22:11, 12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/51/1\" data-bid=\"52-2\" class=\"b\"> 19,&#xA0;20</a>) And on the day of Pentecost, 33&#xA0;C.E., some 120 disciples were apparently in an upper chamber of a house in Jerusalem when God&#x2019;s spirit was poured out upon them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:13-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/52/1\" data-bid=\"53-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:1-4</a>.Usually outside stairs or, in the poorer homes, ladders led from the courtyard to the roof. Therefore, when necessary, a person on the housetop could leave without having to go into the house itself. Since many homes were built close together, it was often possible to walk from rooftop to rooftop. These factors may have some bearing on the meaning of Jesus&#x2019; counsel at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 24:17</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Mark 13:15</a>. In the better homes an interior staircase gave access to the upper story.<strong>The Law Protected Property Rights. </strong>It was Jehovah&#x2019;s purpose that his obedient people have the joy of living in their own houses. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 65:21</a>.) For someone else to gain occupancy of the house of its builder was a calamity to fall upon disobedient ones.

Houses in unwalled villages could be bought back by their original owners and had to be returned to them in the Jubilee year. But houses in walled cities became the permanent property of the buyer if they were not bought back within the allotted one-year period during which the repurchase right continued in force. The right of repurchase was permanent in the case of houses located in walled Levite cities. If not bought back earlier, all houses formerly belonging to Levites had to be returned to their original owners in the Jubilee year.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/63/0\" data-bid=\"64-1\" class=\"b\">Le 25:29-33</a>.<strong>A Place for Spiritual Instruction. </strong>From earliest times the home functioned as a center for giving instruction in pure worship. God&#x2019;s law to Israel specifically commanded fathers to teach their sons when sitting in the house, as well as at other times.

(See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/0\">LEPROSY</a>.) The law concerning leprous houses would have reminded the Israelites that they could live only in homes that were clean from God&#x2019;s standpoint.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/67/0\" data-bid=\"68-1\" class=\"b\">Le 14:33-57</a>.With the establishment of Christianity, preaching and teaching from house to house became a prominent part of true worship.
