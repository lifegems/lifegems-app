This prophecy, pronounced probably in 518&#xA0;B.C.E., showed that Hadrach had incurred Jehovah&#x2019;s displeasure. It is mentioned in association with a number of cities surrounding Israel, such as Damascus, Hamath, Tyre, Sidon, and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and Ashdod.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001807/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 9:1-8</a>.It may be that Hadrach was a city-state that exercised control over the area surrounding it. It is believed to be the Hatarikka of the Assyrian inscriptions, identified with the mound of Tell Afis, about 45&#xA0;km (28&#xA0;mi) SW of Aleppo. Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III lists Hatarikka among the &#x201C;19 districts belonging to Hamath.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Pritchard, 1974, pp.&#xA0;282, 283."}
