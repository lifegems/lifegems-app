The Greek word <em>oi&#x2B9;nos </em>(basically corresponding to the Hebrew term <em>ya&#x2B9;yin</em>) first occurs in Jesus&#x2019; comments on the inadvisability of using old wineskins for <em>new, partially fermented wine, </em>as the pressure developed through fermentation would burst the old wineskins.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 9:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 2:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 5:37,&#xA0;38</a>.Various strong alcoholic liquors, apparently derived from pomegranates, dates, figs, and the like, were usually designated by the Hebrew term <em>she&#xB7;khar&#x2B9;. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 28:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> De 14:26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> Ps 69:12</a>) The Hebrew word <em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;sis&#x2B9;, </em>at The <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Song of Solomon 8:2</a>, refers to &#x201C;the fresh juice&#x201D; of pomegranates, but in other passages the context points to wine.

The vintage season was practically over by the time &#x201C;the festival of booths&#x201D; was celebrated in the early part of autumn. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">De 16:13</a>) After being picked, the grapes were placed in limestone vats, or troughs, where men usually crushed them barefoot, singing songs as they trod the winepress. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 16:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 25:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/11/2\" data-bid=\"12-3\" class=\"b\"> 48:33</a>) With such comparatively gentle crushing methods, the stems and seeds were not broken down, so that little of the tannic acid in the skins was expressed; this, in turn, made for a high-quality wine, one that was smooth and soft on the palate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 7:9</a>) Sometimes heavy stones were used instead of feet.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/0\">PRESS</a>.The first &#x201C;must,&#x201D; or fresh juice, that flows from the broken skins of the grapes, if kept separate from the greater volume of juice extracted under pressure, makes the richest and best wines. Fermentation begins within six hours after the crushing, while the juice is still in the vats, and slowly progresses for a period of several months. The alcohol content of the natural wines varies from 8 to 16&#xA0;percent by volume, but this can be increased by adding alcoholic spirits later on. If grapes are low in sugar content, and fermentation continues too long, or if the wine is not properly protected from oxidizing, it turns to acetic acid, or vinegar.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ru 2:14</a>.During the aging period the wine was kept in jars or skin bottles. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 13:12</a>) These containers were probably vented in such a way as to allow the carbon dioxide gas (a by-product in the conversion of the sugars to alcohol through fermentation) to escape without admitting oxygen from the air to contact and react with the wine.

The red &#x201C;blood of grapes&#x201D; was a fitting representation of Jesus&#x2019; own sacrificial blood. On that occasion Jesus spoke of such wine as &#x201C;this product of the vine,&#x201D; and since it was perhaps seven months after the grape harvest, there can be no question but that it was fermented juice of the vine.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/34/1\" data-bid=\"35-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 26:18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004614/34/2\" data-bid=\"35-3\" class=\"b\"> 27-29</a>.As indicated by Jesus and reported by the physician Luke, wine had certain medicinal value as an antiseptic and mild disinfectant.
