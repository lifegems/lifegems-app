The Hebrew word <em>miz&#xB7;be&#x2B9;ach </em>(altar) comes from the root verb <em>za&#xB7;vach&#x2B9; </em>(slaughter; sacrifice) and thus basically refers to a place of slaughtering or sacrificing.

The altar of burnt offering (also called &#x201C;the altar of copper&#x201D; [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 39:39</a>]) was made of acacia wood in the form of a hollow chest, apparently without top or bottom. It was 2.2&#xA0;m (7.3 ft) square and 1.3&#xA0;m (4.4 ft) high with &#x201C;horns&#x201D; projecting from the upper four corners. All its surfaces were overlaid with copper. A grating, or network, of copper was placed below the altar&#x2019;s rim &#x201C;down within,&#x201D; &#x201C;toward the center.&#x201D; Four rings were placed at the four extremities near the grating, and these appear to be the same rings through which the two copper-sheathed acacia-wood poles were passed for carrying the altar. This might mean that a slot was cut through two sides of the altar allowing for a flat grating to be inserted, with the rings extending out on both sides. There is considerable difference of opinion among scholars on the subject, and many consider it likely that two sets of rings were involved, the second set, for insertion of the carrying poles, being attached directly to the outside of the altar. Copper equipment was made in the form of cans and shovels for the ashes, bowls for catching the blood of the animals, forks for handling the flesh, and fire holders.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 27:1-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 38:1-7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/15/2\" data-bid=\"16-3\" class=\"b\"> 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/15/3\" data-bid=\"16-4\" class=\"b\"> Nu 4:14</a>.This copper altar for burnt offerings was placed before the entrance of the tabernacle.

(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Le 9:22</a>, which states that Aaron &#x201C;came down&#x201D; from making offerings.)

A border of gold ran around the top. The altar measured 44.5&#xA0;cm (17.5 in.) square and 89&#xA0;cm (2.9 ft) high, and also had &#x201C;horns&#x201D; extending out from the four top corners. Two gold rings were made for the insertion of the carrying poles made of acacia overlaid with gold, and these rings were placed underneath the gold border on opposite sides of the altar.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 3:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/42/1\" data-bid=\"43-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 16:39, 40;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/42/2\" data-bid=\"43-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:29, 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/42/3\" data-bid=\"43-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 1:3-6</a>) The copper altar thereafter made for the temple covered an area 16 times as large as the one made for the tabernacle, measuring about 8.9&#xA0;m (29.2 ft) square and about 4.5&#xA0;m (14.6 ft) high. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 4:1</a>) In view of its height, some means of approach was essential. God&#x2019;s law prohibited the use of steps to the altar to prevent exposure of nakedness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 20:26</a>) Some believe that the linen drawers worn by Aaron and his sons served to obviate this command and thus made steps allowable.

Josephus (<em>The Jewish War, </em>V, 225 [v,&#xA0;6]) indicates that such an approach was used for the temple altar later built by Herod. If the arrangement of the altar of the temple followed that of the tabernacle, the ramp was probably on the S side of the altar. &#x201C;The molten sea,&#x201D; where the priests washed, would thus be convenient, as it also lay toward the south.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:2</a>) The blood of sacrificial animals was poured out at the altar&#x2019;s base, and it is likely that some kind of conduit existed for carrying the blood away from the temple area. Herod&#x2019;s temple is reported to have had such a conduit connected with the SW horn of the altar, and in the rock of the temple area, an opening has been found that leads to an underground channel going out to the Kidron Valley.The altar of incense for the temple was made of cedarwood, but this seems to have been the only difference between it and that of the tabernacle.

(1 Maccabees 1:20-64) Judas Maccabaeus thereafter built a new altar of unhewn stones and also restored the altar of incense.<wbr>&#x2014;1 Maccabees 4:44-49.The altar of burnt offerings of Herod&#x2019;s temple was made of unhewn stones and, according to Josephus (<em>The Jewish War, </em>V, 225 [v,&#xA0;6]), was 50 cubits square and 15 cubits high, though the Jewish Mishnah (<em>Middot </em>3:1) gives smaller dimensions for it.

The altar consisted of several sections successively indented or recessed. Its dimensions are given in measurements of the long cubit (51.8 cm; 20.4&#xA0;in.). The base of the altar was one cubit thick and had a &#x201C;lip&#x201D; of one span (perhaps 26&#xA0;cm; 10&#xA0;in.) as a border around the top, thus forming a sort of gutter or channel, perhaps for receiving blood poured out.

A third section was stepped in one cubit and was four cubits (c.&#xA0;207&#xA0;cm; 82&#xA0;in.) in height. It also had a border surrounding it of a half cubit (c.&#xA0;26&#xA0;cm; 10&#xA0;in.), perhaps forming a second channel or a protective ledge. Finally, the altar hearth extended up yet another four cubits and was also stepped in one cubit from the preceding section; out from it extended four &#x201C;horns.&#x201D; Stairs from the E provided approach to the altar hearth.

The altar of burnt offerings represented God&#x2019;s &#x201C;will,&#x201D; that is, his willingness to accept the perfect human sacrifice of his only-begotten Son. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/100/0\" data-bid=\"101-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:5-10</a>) Its location in front of the entrance to the sanctuary emphasizes the requirement of faith in that ransom sacrifice as a prerequisite for acceptance by God. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/101/0\" data-bid=\"102-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:16-18</a>) The insistence upon a single altar of sacrifice is in harmony with Christ&#x2019;s declaration: &#x201C;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me,&#x201D; as well as with the many texts declaring the unity to be manifest in the Christian faith.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/102/0\" data-bid=\"103-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/102/1\" data-bid=\"103-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 7:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/102/2\" data-bid=\"103-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 1:10-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/102/3\" data-bid=\"103-4\" class=\"b\"> Eph 4:3-6</a>; note also Isaiah&#x2019;s prophecy, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/103/0\" data-bid=\"104-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 56:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/103/1\" data-bid=\"104-2\" class=\"b\"> 60:7</a>, that people of all nations would come to God&#x2019;s altar.It is notable that, though some individuals fled to the altar, taking hold of its horns, in hope of gaining protection, God&#x2019;s law prescribed that the willful murderer was to be taken &#x201C;even from being at my altar to die.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/104/0\" data-bid=\"105-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:14</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/105/0\" data-bid=\"106-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 1:50-53;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000210/105/1\" data-bid=\"106-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:28-34</a>.)
