But in order to relieve the tribe of Levi of military service (so it could devote its time exclusively to religious matters) and still retain 12 tribes having 12 portions in the Promised Land, formal genealogical adjustments were made.

In this way the firstborn rights were taken away from Reuben, the firstborn of Leah, and given to Joseph, the firstborn of Rachel.

The latter, during the rule of Antiochus&#xA0;IV (Epiphanes), determined to eradicate Jewish worship and customs. His effort reached a climax in 168&#xA0;B.C.E. when a pagan altar was erected atop the temple altar in Jerusalem and dedicated to the Greek god Zeus. This outrageous incident, however, had a reverse effect, for it was the spark that touched off the Maccabean uprising. Three years later, to the day, <span id=\"page1232\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1232\" data-before-text=\"1232\"></span>victorious Jewish leader Judas Maccabaeus rededicated the cleansed temple to Jehovah with a festival that has since been commemorated by the Jews as Hanukkah.The century that followed was one of great internal disorder in which Israel was led farther and farther away from the tribal administrative provisions of the Law covenant. It was during this period when home rule by the Maccabeans or Hasmonaeans met with varying fortunes, and when the parties of the pro-Hasmonaean Sadducees and the anti-Hasmonaean Pharisees developed. Finally Rome, by now the world power, was called upon to interfere. General Gnaeus Pompey intervened, and after a three-month siege he took Jerusalem in 63&#xA0;B.C.E. and annexed Judea to the empire. Herod the Great was appointed king of the Jews by Rome in about 39&#xA0;B.C.E., and about three years later he effectively crushed the Hasmonaean rule. Shortly before Herod&#x2019;s death Jesus was born in 2&#xA0;B.C.E., as &#x201C;a glory of your people Israel.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002227/77/0\" data-bid=\"78-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 2:32</a>.Rome&#x2019;s imperial authority over Israel during the first century C.E. was distributed among district rulers and governors, or procurators.

Fanatical elements in Israel fomented one revolt after another, and each time the province suffered harsh Roman reprisals, reprisals that, in turn, increased the Jewish hatred of Roman rule. The situation finally became so explosive that the local Roman forces were no longer able to contain it and Cestius Gallus, governor of Syria, moved against Jerusalem with stronger forces to maintain Roman control.After setting fire to Bezetha, N of the temple, Gallus encamped in front of the royal palace, SW of the temple. At that moment, Josephus says, he could have easily forced his way into the city; his delay, however, strengthened the insurgents. The advance units of the Romans then made a protective covering, like the back of the tortoise, with their shields over themselves and began undermining the walls. Again when the Romans were about to succeed, they withdrew in the fall of 66&#xA0;C.E. Concerning this withdrawal, Josephus says: &#x201C;Cestius .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. suddenly recalled his troops, renounced his hopes, without having suffered any reverse, and, contrary to all calculation, retired from the city.&#x201D; (<em>The Jewish War, </em>II, 540 [xix,&#xA0;7]) This attack on the city, followed by the sudden withdrawal, furnished the signal and the opportunity for the Christians there to &#x2018;flee to the mountains&#x2019; as instructed by Jesus.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002227/90/0\" data-bid=\"91-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 21:20-22</a>.The next year (67&#xA0;C.E.) Vespasian set about putting down the Jewish uprising, but Nero&#x2019;s unexpected death in 68 opened the way for Vespasian to become emperor. So he returned to Rome in 69 and left his son Titus to continue the campaign, and the next year, 70&#xA0;C.E., Jerusalem was entered and destroyed. Three years later the last Jewish stronghold at Masada fell to the Romans. Josephus says that during the whole campaign against Jerusalem 1,100,000 Jews died, many from pestilence and famine, and 97,000 were taken captive, he says, many being scattered as slaves to all quarters of the empire.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Jewish War, </em>VI, 420 (ix,&#xA0;3).For the identity of &#x201C;the twelve tribes of Israel&#x201D; that are referred to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002227/91/0\" data-bid=\"92-1\" class=\"b\">Matthew 19:28</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002227/92/0\" data-bid=\"93-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 22:30</a>, see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002227/3\">TRIBE</a> (&#x201C;Judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel&#x201D;).<strong>3. </strong>The tribes that twice formed a separate northern kingdom of Israel.The first split in the national government came with the death of Saul in about 1078&#xA0;B.C.E.
