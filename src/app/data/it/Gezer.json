Gezer is first mentioned when its king unsuccessfully tried to save Lachish from the Israelite army under Joshua.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001673/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 16:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001673/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:29</a>) Gezer was also appointed to the Kohathites as a Levite city.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001673/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 21:20, 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001673/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 6:66,&#xA0;67</a>.The city was associated with the Philistines in David&#x2019;s time, as when he broke their power &#x201C;from Geba to as far as Gezer.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001673/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 5:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001673/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 14:16</a>) Also, Sibbecai the Hushathite distinguished himself during the defeat of the Philistines at Gezer by striking down Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001673/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 20:4</a>) Egypt&#x2019;s Pharaoh later came against Gezer for some unstated reason. After <span id=\"page928\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"928\" data-before-text=\"928\"></span>burning the city and killing its Canaanite population, he gave it as a dowry to Solomon&#x2019;s wife. Solomon rebuilt and possibly fortified the city.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001673/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 9:15-17</a>.Gezer also finds frequent mention in secular records. On the walls of the temple at Karnak, Thutmose&#xA0;III recorded the capture of Gezer. The city later played a prominent role in the Amarna Tablets, being mentioned by name at least nine times. Pharaoh Merneptah boasted on his stele that he &#x2018;seized Gezer.&#x2019;Scholars consider ancient Gezer to be modern Tell Jezer (Abu Shusheh; Tel Gezer), located about midway on the route between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv-Yafo (Joppa). It thus lay near another great highway that has for millenniums connected Egypt with Mesopotamia for trade and military purposes. Tell Jezer&#x2019;s elevated position on a ridge of the Shephelah allowed it to command use of both of these roads.Archaeological digging first began at this tell early in the 20th&#xA0;century. Since then it has become one of the most thoroughly excavated and explored sites in Palestine. Among the finds there are the &#x201C;Solomonic gate and casemate wall,&#x201D; built upon a layer of destruction debris that some conjecture to be the result of Pharaoh&#x2019;s burning of Gezer. Its architecture is considered to be so similar to that found in structures at Hazor and Megiddo as to indicate that all three were built from the same plans. Earlier strata show Philistine pottery in abundance. Perhaps the most famous find to come out of Tell Jezer, however, is the Gezer &#x201C;calendar,&#x201D; a plaque containing what appear to be a schoolboy&#x2019;s memory exercises. It has proved to be of value by informing modern researchers of ancient Israel&#x2019;s agricultural seasons and providing a glimpse into the Hebrew script and language of Solomon&#x2019;s day."}
