Nevertheless, on the basis of archaeological research, it has been possible to reconstruct in a tentative way some of the key parts of the city. This can help students to visualize the events that took place there in connection with the ministry of Jesus and that of his apostles.When in Jerusalem at festival times, Jesus taught in the temple area where the crowds were. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 7:14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 18:20</a>) Following his death and resurrection, his disciples &#x2018;filled Jerusalem with their teaching.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 5:28</a>) From Jerusalem, their witnessing eventually spread to &#x201C;the most distant part of the earth.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:8</a>.The activity of Jesus and his disciples confronted the nation with an important issue: Would they accept the one whom Jehovah sent as Messiah? Would they recognize their need of the Kingdom of God? Though some put faith in Jesus, most were unresponsive. The nation&#x2019;s faithless actions were climaxed by the impalement of Jesus, which took place with popular support at Jerusalem. As a result, destruction befell the city in 70&#xA0;C.E., just as Jesus had foretold.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 19:41-44</a>.<strong>[Chart/<wbr>Map on page&#xA0;542]</strong>(For fully formatted text, see publication)This outer north wall was started by Herod Agrippa&#xA0;I, who ruled c.&#xA0;41-44&#xA0;C.E.<em>Pool of Bethzatha</em> HOUSESTower of AntoniaTemple Soreg Court of the Gentiles Solomon&#x2019;s Colonnade Royal ColonnadeSanhedrin Hall (?)Governor&#x2019;s Palace HOUSES<em>Aqueduct</em><em>Tyropoeon Valley</em><em>Pool of Siloam</em><em>Spring of Gihon</em><em>T.V. of Kidron</em><em>Valley of Hinnom </em>(<em>Gehenna</em>)<strong>[Chart]</strong><strong>PRINCIPAL LOCATIONS With Related Scriptures</strong>Court of the Gentiles (?)&#xA0; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 2:13-17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 21:12, 13</a>Solomon&#x2019;s Colonnade        <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 10:22-39;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 3:11&#x2013;4:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 5:12</a>Soreg                      <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 2:14</a>, ftnTower of Antonia           <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 21:34&#x2013;22:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 23:10, 11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 16-30</a>Governor&#x2019;s Palace          <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 18:28&#x2013;19:16</a>Sanhedrin Hall             <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 22:66-71;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 4:5-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 5:27-41</a>;                             <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">6:12&#x2013;7:57;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 22:30&#x2013;23:10</a>Pool of Bethzatha          <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 5:1-9</a>Pool of Siloam             <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 9:6-11</a>Valley of Hinnom           <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 9:47, 48;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003304/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> Jas 3:6</a><span id=\"page543\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"543\" data-before-text=\"543\"></span><strong>[Diagram on page&#xA0;543]</strong>(For fully formatted text, see publication)Diagram of the reconstructed temple area as it existed in the first century C.E.HolyMost HolyMolten SeaAltar of Burnt OfferingCourt of PriestsCourt of WomenCourt of IsraelBarrier (Soreg)Court of the GentilesRoyal ColonnadeSolomon&#x2019;s Colonnade<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;543]</strong>Jerusalem as it likely appeared in the first century.
