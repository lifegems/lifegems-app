The city was renamed &#x201C;Hormah,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;A Devoting to Destruction.&#x201D; This city, like the other cities of the Canaanites, had been placed &#x2018;under ban&#x2019; by Jehovah and was to be devoted to destruction. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004698/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">De 7:1-4</a>) The tribes of Judah and Simeon were now applying the terms of that ban to Zephath.
