Pedaiah became father to postexilic Governor Zerubbabel and was therefore a vital link in the line leading to Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 3:17-19</a>) Because of some unrecorded circumstance, Zerubbabel is also called the son of Pedaiah&#x2019;s brother Shealtiel. Shealtiel may have adopted Zerubbabel if Pedaiah died when the boy was young; or, if Shealtiel died before fathering a son, Pedaiah may have performed brother-in-law marriage, fathering Zerubbabel in the name of his brother Shealtiel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 5:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 1:12</a>.<strong>4. </strong>A Benjamite whose descendant lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 11:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;7</a>.<strong>5. </strong>A descendant of Parosh who helped Nehemiah repair Jerusalem&#x2019;s wall.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:25</a>.<strong>6. </strong>A postexilic Israelite, probably a priest, who stood at Ezra&#x2019;s left during the reading of Jehovah&#x2019;s Law to the assembled people.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 8:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;4</a>.<strong>7. </strong>A faithful Levite whom Nehemiah, on his second visit to Jerusalem, assigned with Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the copyist to take charge of the contributed tithe.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 13:6, 7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003414/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 12,&#xA0;13</a>."}
