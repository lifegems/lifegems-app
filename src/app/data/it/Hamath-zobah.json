(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001835/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 8:3</a>) The exact identity of Hamath-zobah is uncertain. Hamath and Zobah may have been adjoining kingdoms (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001835/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 18:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001835/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 8:4</a>), whence the compound name &#x201C;Hamath-zobah.&#x201D; That two neighboring geographic locations may be joined in this way is illustrated by <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001835/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 6:78</a>. The literal Hebrew of this text reads &#x201C;the Jordan Jericho,&#x201D; or &#x201C;the Jordan of Jericho,&#x201D; and is usually rendered &#x201C;the Jordan at [by] Jericho.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>NW, RS, KJ.</em>"}
