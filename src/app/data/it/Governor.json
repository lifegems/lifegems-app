But Rabshakeh failed to take into account the overwhelming force of Jehovah on Hezekiah&#x2019;s side.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001749/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 36:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001749/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001749/11/2\" data-bid=\"12-3\" class=\"b\"> 37:36</a>.Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah to govern the remaining Israelites left in the land of Judah after carrying many of the people into exile in 607&#xA0;B.C.E.

Christians should not fear such rulers, though powerful, nor be worried about what to say when giving testimony before them.

This circumstance was used by Jehovah in strong reproof to the nation through his prophet Malachi.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001749/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Mal 1:6-8</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001749/1\">SUPERIOR AUTHORITIES</a>.Matthew, quoting from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001749/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Micah 5:2</a>, shows that Bethlehem, though very insignificant as far as governing power in Judah was concerned, would become significant by reason of the fact that the greatest of governors would come from this city to shepherd Jehovah&#x2019;s people Israel. This prophecy finds its fulfillment in Christ Jesus the Great Governor under his Father, Jehovah God.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001749/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 2:6</a>."}
