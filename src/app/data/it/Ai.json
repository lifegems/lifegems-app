Ai was situated &#x201C;close by Beth-aven, to the east of Bethel,&#x201D; with a valley plain to the N.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000178/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 7:4-15</a>) After correction of this matter, Joshua employed a stratagem against Ai, setting an ambush at the rear of the city on its W side. The main force was deployed before the city to the N, where a valley or low desert plain lay, and from here Joshua prepared for a frontal attack on Ai. Having lured the king of Ai and a body of men out of Ai, Joshua&#x2019;s force feigned retreat until their pursuers were far from their fortress. Then the ambush was signaled into action, and the city was captured and set on fire.

It is 2.3&#xA0;km (1.4&#xA0;mi) ESE of Bethel (modern Beitin). However, excavations made there in 1933-1935 and in 1964-1972 indicate that it was a large city, devastated about 2000&#xA0;B.C.E. and thereafter uninhabited until about 1050&#xA0;B.C.E. (according to archaeological methods of dating). Because of this, various attempts have been made by archaeologists to alter the sense of the Scriptural references to Ai. However, archaeologist J.&#xA0;Simons finds the identification with Khirbet et-Tell unacceptable on the basis of the city&#x2019;s size (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000178/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 7:3</a>), the fact that there is no broad valley to the N of Khirbet et-Tell (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000178/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 8:11</a>), and on other grounds. (<em>American Journal of Archaeology, </em>July-September&#xA0;1947, p.&#xA0;311) If the archaeological dating is correct, then the site must be located elsewhere. The name itself would not necessarily identify the place, since as Sir Frederic Kenyon states: &#x201C;The transference of a name from a ruined or abandoned site to another near by is a common phenomenon in Palestine.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Bible and Archaeology, </em>1940, p.&#xA0;190.<strong>2. </strong>A city mentioned along with Heshbon in Jeremiah&#x2019;s prophecy against the Ammonites.
