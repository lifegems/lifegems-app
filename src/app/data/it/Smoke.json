Aside from the mention of literal smoke (Heb., <em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;shan&#x2B9;; </em>Gr., <em>ka&#xB7;pnos&#x2B9;</em>) in numerous instances, there are a number of figurative uses of the word, and there is figurative meaning to the appearance of smoke itself.<strong>Jehovah&#x2019;s Presence, and His Anger. </strong>Jehovah has manifested his presence by a cloud of &#x201C;smoke,&#x201D; sometimes accompanied by fire. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 19:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 4:5</a>) He symbolized his presence in this way at the visionary temples seen by Isaiah the prophet and by John the apostle.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 6:1-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 15:8</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/0\">CLOUD</a>.Smoke is also associated with Jehovah&#x2019;s burning anger.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 20:38-40</a>) It was also an evidence that something was being destroyed by fire, as, for example, smoke rising from a distant city.

It is used with regard to: God&#x2019;s enemies (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 68:2</a>), idol worshipers (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 13:3</a>), and the shortened life of the afflicted one (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 102:3</a>).&#x201C;As vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so the lazy man is to those sending him forth,&#x201D; says the proverb. Just as smoke causes the eyes to sting and smart, so the one who employs a lazy man does so to the injury of his own purposes.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 10:26</a>.The psalmist, waiting for Jehovah to comfort him, says: &#x201C;I have become like a skin bottle in the smoke.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 119:83</a>) Skin bottles, such as those used in the Middle East, hanging on the wall when not in use, became dried up and shriveled from the smoke of the house. So the psalmist had become at the hands of those persecuting him.Jehovah, in describing his creations to Job, calls attention to Leviathan, saying: &#x201C;Out of [its] nostrils smoke goes forth, like a furnace set aflame even with rushes.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004165/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Job 41:20</a>) Many Bible scholars believe that God here had reference to the crocodile, which, when coming up out of the water, breathes out a thick, steamy vapor with a thundering sound.<strong>Sacrificial Smoke. </strong>Another Hebrew word, <em>qa&#xB7;tar&#x2B9;, </em>has reference to making sacrificial smoke, whether that of incense or of another sacrifice on the altar.
