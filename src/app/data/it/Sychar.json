It was &#x201C;near the field that Jacob gave to Joseph his son&#x201D; in the vicinity of Shechem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004279/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 4:5,&#xA0;6</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004279/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 24:32</a>.) The Syriac Sinaitic codex has &#x201C;Sychem&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Sychar.&#x201D; However, the best Greek manuscripts support the reading &#x201C;Sychar.&#x201D; Certain early non-Biblical writers distinguish between Shechem and Sychar; others do not. Recent excavations have led some to identify Sychar tentatively with the village of &#x2BD;Askar, 0.7&#xA0;km (0.4&#xA0;mi) NNE of Jacob&#x2019;s fountain and about 1&#xA0;km (0.6&#xA0;mi) NE of Shechem."}
