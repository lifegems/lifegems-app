(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004150/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 6:5</a>) Since the sistrum is characteristically played in this manner, being, as it were, a musical rattle, many lexicographers and music historians favor this rendering, one that has also been adopted by a number of Bible translators.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Da; NW; Ro; Vg.</em><span id=\"page976\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"976\" data-before-text=\"976\"></span>The sistrum generally consisted of a small oval metal frame attached to a handle. The complete instrument varied from about 20 to 46&#xA0;cm (8 to 18&#xA0;in.) in length, according to extant ancient specimens as well as Egyptian and other monumental representations. The frame loosely held a small number of metal crossbars that, when shaken, produced sharp, ringing sounds. The horizontal bars may have been of differing lengths so as to produce a series of tones. Another type of sistrum was equipped with rings on the bars, and these rings jingled when agitated. Although its single Biblical appearance is in the description of a great celebration, traditional Jewish sources state that the sistrum was played on sad occasions as well."}
