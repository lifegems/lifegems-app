The cassia bark tree (<em>Cinnamomum cassia</em>) now grows in eastern Asia and is of the same family as the cinnamon tree. It may reach a height of 12&#xA0;m (40&#xA0;ft) and has glossy, stiff leaves. The inner bark of the branches (called cassia lignea), when cut, dries and peels off, rolling itself into tubes, which are then sent to market. The cassia bark is coarser and more pungent than cinnamon bark. The buds are used as cloves in preparing food dishes, and the mature flowers, when dried, serve as an aromatic incense.When the holy anointing oil was prepared at the time of making the tabernacle, cassia was included among the ingredients as one of &#x201C;the choicest perfumes.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000903/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:23-25</a>) Cassia was prominent among the products in which the merchants and traders of the city of Tyre dealt.

The only other occurrence of this word is as the name of Job&#x2019;s second daughter, Keziah, born after his recovery from illness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000903/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Job 42:14</a>."}
