Enosh was 90 years old when he became father to Kenan, and he lived a total of 905 years. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001372/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 5:6-11</a>) His name is also listed in the genealogies at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001372/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 1:1</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001372/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 3:38</a>. In his day &#x201C;a start was made of calling on the name of Jehovah.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001372/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 4:26</a>) This was evidently not a calling on Jehovah in faith and pure worship as Abel had done more than 105 years before Enosh&#x2019;s birth. Some Hebrew scholars contend that the text should read &#x201C;began profanely,&#x201D; or &#x201C;then profanation began.&#x201D; With reference to Enosh&#x2019;s day the Jerusalem Targum says: &#x201C;That was the generation in whose days they began to err, and to make themselves idols, and surnamed their idols by the name of the Word of the Lord.&#x201D; Men may <span id=\"page730\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"730\" data-before-text=\"730\"></span>have applied Jehovah&#x2019;s name to themselves or to other men through whom they pretended to approach God in worship; or else they applied his name to idol objects."}
