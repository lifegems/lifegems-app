Based on the average of some 45 inscribed shekel weights, the shekel may be reckoned at 11.4&#xA0;g (0.403&#xA0;oz avdp; 0.367&#xA0;oz t). One shekel equaled 20 gerahs (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 3:47;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:16</a>), and there is evidence that 50 shekels equaled one mina. (See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/0\">MINA</a>.) Calculated in modern values, a shekel of silver would be worth $2.20, and a shekel of gold, $128.45.The shekel is often referred to in connection with silver or gold. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 21:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Ne 5:15</a>) Before coins were used, pieces of silver (and, less frequently, gold) were used for money, the weight being checked at the time the transaction was made. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 23:15, 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Jos 7:21</a>) Things pertaining to the tabernacle were sometimes stated in terms of shekels &#x201C;by the shekel of the holy place.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 30:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Le 5:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 27:2-7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;25</a>) This may have been to emphasize that the weight should be precise or, perhaps, that it should conform to a standard weight kept at the tabernacle.It is generally thought that the &#x201C;silver pieces&#x201D; often mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures were silver shekels, the standard monetary unit. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 16:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 10:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> Ho 3:2</a>) This is borne out by the <em>Septuagint </em>(in which the Greek word for &#x201C;silver pieces&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 20:16</a> is the same as the Greek word for &#x201C;shekels&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 23:15,&#xA0;16</a>) as well as by the Targums. According to <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 32:9</a>, the prophet paid &#x201C;seven shekels and ten silver pieces&#x201D; for a field. Perhaps this was simply a legal formula meaning 17 silver shekels (<em>AS, Da, NE, RS</em>), or possibly, it meant seven <em>gold </em>shekels and ten silver shekels.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003987/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Second Samuel 14:26</a> may indicate that there was a &#x201C;royal&#x201D; shekel different from the common shekel, or the reference may be to a standard weight kept at the royal palace."}
