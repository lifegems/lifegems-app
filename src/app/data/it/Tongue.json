What is commonly called taste results from reactions of the taste buds <em>plus </em>the aroma detected by the sense of smell. More important, the tongue is also essential to speech, because articulation of words requires active maneuvering on its part, which it does with dexterity and remarkable speed.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/0\">MOUTH</a> (The Palate).In Bible usage, &#x201C;tongue&#x201D; often stands for &#x201C;language.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> De 28:49;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 28:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Ac 2:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> 19:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/0/5\" data-bid=\"1-6\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 12:10</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/1\">LANGUAGE</a>.)

He points out that failure to bridle the tongue can be a factor in causing one&#x2019;s worship to be futile. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 1:26</a>) He likens the tongue to a fire that can destroy a forest. The unbridled tongue can be influenced by destructive forces and can bring about such a great quantity or extent of unrighteousness that it can contaminate the individual&#x2019;s entire life. It can be poisonous, spiritually, to oneself and to others. It cannot be tamed by man&#x2019;s own efforts; nor can any imperfect human be completely exempt from &#x2018;stumbling in word.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 3:2-8</a>) But the taming of this unruly organ of the imperfect human flesh is not impossible for <span id=\"page1114\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1114\" data-before-text=\"1114\"></span>the Christian, for by Jehovah&#x2019;s undeserved kindness through Christ a person can bridle his tongue and can make over his personality.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 3:10-18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 3:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> Col 3:9, 10</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 34:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004448/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 39:1</a>.In harmony with James&#x2019; description of the tongue, the writer of Proverbs says that the calmness of the tongue can be &#x201C;a tree of life.&#x201D; On the other hand, a distortion in it can mean &#x201C;a breaking down in the spirit&#x201D;; death and life are in its power.
