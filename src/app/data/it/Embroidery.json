Interweaving of patterns and figures in cloth by means of needlework is first mentioned Biblically in connection with Israel&#x2019;s tabernacle. Jehovah filled the tabernacle workmen Bezalel and Oholiab with wisdom of heart to do, among other things, all the work of an embroiderer, distinguished from the work of a weaver.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 35:30-35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 38:21-23</a>.In keeping with divine instructions, cherubs were skillfully embroidered on the tabernacle tent cloths, these figures being visible from within the Holy and the Most Holy. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 26:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 36:8</a>) Cherubs were also embroidered on the curtain that separated these tabernacle compartments.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 26:31-33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 36:35</a>.To make the ephod worn by the high priest, plates of gold were beaten into thin sheets, from which were cut threads &#x201C;to work in among the blue thread and the wool dyed reddish purple and the coccus scarlet material and the fine linen, as the work of an embroiderer.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 39:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 28:6</a>) Similarly, &#x201C;workmanship of an embroiderer&#x201D; went into making the high priest&#x2019;s &#x201C;breastpiece of judgment.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 28:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 39:8</a>.The victory song of Barak and Deborah represents Sisera&#x2019;s mother as expecting him to return from battling Israel with spoils that included embroidered garments. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 5:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 28,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;30</a>) In love, Jehovah had figuratively clothed Jerusalem with a costly &#x201C;embroidered garment.&#x201D; But her idolatrous inhabitants had evidently used literal embroidered garments to cover the images of a male with which she is represented as prostituting herself. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 16:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/6/3\" data-bid=\"7-4\" class=\"b\"> 17,&#xA0;18</a>) Jehovah also foretold through Ezekiel that, at wealthy Tyre&#x2019;s downfall at Babylonian hands, dethroned &#x201C;chieftains of the sea&#x201D; would &#x201C;strip off their own embroidered garments.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 26:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001349/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> 15,&#xA0;16</a>."}
