Bounding Issachar were the tribal territories of Zebulun and Naphtali on the N, the Jordan River on the E, Manasseh&#x2019;s territory on the S, and on the W a portion of Asher&#x2019;s allotment. Mount Tabor lay along its northern boundary with Zebulun, while the city of Megiddo was near its SW border and Beth-shean was toward its SE boundary. Within this territory there were a number of Canaanite cities and their dependent settlements.

Issachar seems to have accepted well the hard labor involved in such work. Willingness is indicated by his &#x2018;bending down his shoulder to bear burdens.&#x2019; So, while the tribe was not particularly outstanding, it apparently could be commended for taking on the load of responsibility that was its share.Certain cities within Issachar&#x2019;s possession were designated as enclave cities belonging to the neighbor tribe of Manasseh, including the prominent cities of Megiddo and Beth-shean.
