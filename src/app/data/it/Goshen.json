(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001745/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 45:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001745/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 47:27</a>) While the exact location of Goshen is uncertain, it appears to have lain in the eastern part of the Nile Delta, the entrance to Egypt proper. This is indicated by the fact that Joseph, leaving his Egyptian quarters, met his father (who was traveling from Canaan) at Goshen. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001745/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 46:28,&#xA0;29</a>) Greek <em>Septuagint </em>renderings indicate that Goshen was in the vicinity of the Wadi Tumilat.Pharaoh kept cattle at Goshen, and the Hebrews also pastured their flocks and herds there.

Goshen may have been the same as &#x201C;the land of Rameses.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001745/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 47:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001745/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;11</a>) Beginning with the fourth blow on Egypt, Jehovah specifically singled out &#x201C;Goshen&#x201D; to be left unharmed.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001745/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 8:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001745/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 9:26</a>.<strong>2. </strong>A city in the mountainous region of Judah.
