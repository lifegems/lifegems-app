He Has Made Haste to the Plunder; or, Hurrying to the Spoil, He Has Made Haste to the Plunder].The name given to Isaiah&#x2019;s second son at Jehovah&#x2019;s direction.Jehovah commanded Isaiah to write these prophetic words on a large tablet and have it attested to by reliable witnesses. Thereafter, he instructed the prophet to give this same expression as a name to his newborn son, declaring that before the child could say, &#x201C;My father!&#x201D; and &#x201C;My mother!&#x201D; the king of Assyria would subjugate Judah&#x2019;s enemies<wbr>&#x2014;Damascus and Samaria. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002848/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 8:1-4</a>) The prophetic meaning of this name given to Isaiah&#x2019;s second son was fulfilled within the designated time period. During the reign of Israel&#x2019;s King Pekah, the Assyrian monarch Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III invaded Israel, took many cities, plundered the land, and carried numerous inhabitants into captivity. Thereafter, Pekah was murdered. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002848/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 15:29,&#xA0;30</a>) The king of Assyria also captured Syria&#x2019;s capital city Damascus, took its people into exile, and put Syrian King Rezin to death. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002848/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 16:9</a>) In this way both of these kings who had conspired against Judah met their end. Later, in <span id=\"page297\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"297\" data-before-text=\"297\"></span>740&#xA0;B.C.E., the Assyrians overthrew Samaria, removing the apostate Israelites from that city and from the rest of the domain of the northern kingdom of Israel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002848/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:1-6</a>) Thus, this boy born to Isaiah by his wife (whom he terms &#x201C;the prophetess&#x201D;) proved to be in Israel a truthful and reliable &#x2018;sign and miracle&#x2019; from Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002848/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 8:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002848/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;18</a>."}
