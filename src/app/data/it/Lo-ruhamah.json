Jehovah told the prophet to give the child this name because He would &#x201C;no more show mercy again to the house of Israel.&#x201D; God thus indicated his rejection of Israel as a whole. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002774/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 1:6-8</a>) Earlier, when Jezreel was born, it was said that Gomer &#x201C;bore to him [Hosea] a son,&#x201D; but regarding Lo-ruhamah it is only stated that Gomer &#x201C;proceeded to become pregnant another time and to give birth to a daughter,&#x201D; without direct personal reference to Hosea. Though the account does not specifically say, it has been suggested that this child was the fruit of Gomer&#x2019;s adultery and was not the prophet&#x2019;s own offspring. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002774/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 1:2,&#xA0;3</a>) There is allusion to her symbolic name in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002774/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Hosea 2:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002774/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>."}
