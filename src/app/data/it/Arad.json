The Israelites devoted the district to destruction and called it &#x201C;Hormah,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;A Devoting to Destruction.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000329/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 21:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000329/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 33:40</a>) They did not then settle there, however, and evidently some of the inhabitants escaped destruction. Hence, the king of Arad is included in the list of 31 kings later vanquished in Joshua&#x2019;s whirlwind campaign.

It lies on a somewhat rolling plain about 28&#xA0;km (17&#xA0;mi) E of Beer-sheba. Excavations at Tel &#x2BD;Arad uncovered some 200 ostraca, about half of them in Hebrew and the rest in Aramaic. One such Hebrew potsherd, said to be from the second half of the seventh century B.C.E., reads: &#x201C;To my lord Eliashib: May Jehovah ask for your peace. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. He dwells in the house of Jehovah.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;PICTURE, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;325.Because of the absence of late Canaanite remains at Tel &#x2BD;Arad, Y.&#xA0;Aharoni suggests that Canaanite Arad was located at Tell el-Milh (Tel Malhata), 12&#xA0;km (7&#xA0;mi) SW of Tel &#x2BD;Arad.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;142]</strong>Ruins of a fortress at Tel &#x2BD;Arad.
