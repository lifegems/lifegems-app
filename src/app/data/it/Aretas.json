Emperor Tiberius then ordered the governor of Syria, Vitellius, to take Aretas dead or alive. Vitellius, himself no friend of Antipas, mobilized his forces, but Tiberius died in 37&#xA0;C.E., and the campaign against Aretas was called off. Tiberius&#x2019; successor Caligula reversed this foreign policy, installed Herod Agrippa&#xA0;I in place of Antipas, and permitted Aretas to rule Damascus. A coin of Damascus bearing an inscription of Aretas is dated in this period."}
