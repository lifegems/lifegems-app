The refining, forging, and casting of metals, along with the preparing of food and the heating of homes, as well as the offering of sacrifices and the burning of incense, are among the things specifically mentioned in the Bible as requiring the use of fire. However, because of the destructiveness of uncontrolled fire, it is described as one of the four things that have not said: &#x201C;Enough!&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 30:15,&#xA0;16</a>) For the same reason James compared the tongue when used wrongly to a fire.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 3:5-8</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 16:27</a>.The first man and woman were acquainted with fire, for Jehovah, upon expelling them from the garden of Eden, posted at the E of the garden &#x201C;the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning itself continually.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:24</a>) Cain and Abel may have brought their offerings to Jehovah before the cherubs and, though it is not directly stated in the Scriptures, likely they used fire in presenting them, or they may have expected fire to come from the cherubs to consume the sacrifices.

On one occasion Jesus warned his disciples against letting their hand, foot, or eye stumble them so that they would be pitched into Gehenna. Then he went on to say: &#x201C;Everyone must be salted with fire.&#x201D; He must have meant that &#x201C;everyone&#x201D; who did what he had just warned against would be salted with the &#x201C;fire&#x201D; of Gehenna, or eternal destruction.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 9:43-49</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/2\">GEHENNA</a>.Peter wrote that &#x201C;the heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire.&#x201D; From the context and in the light of other scriptures, it is evident that this is not a literal fire but signifies everlasting destruction. As the Flood of Noah&#x2019;s day did not destroy the literal heavens and earth, but only the ungodly persons, so also the revelation of Jesus Christ with his powerful angels in a flaming fire will result in permanent destruction only for the ungodly and the wicked system of things of which they are a part.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 3:5-7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/53/1\" data-bid=\"54-2\" class=\"b\"> 10-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/53/2\" data-bid=\"54-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Th 1:6-10</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 66:15, 16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/54/1\" data-bid=\"55-2\" class=\"b\"> 22,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001523/54/2\" data-bid=\"55-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;24</a>.Further examples of the use of fire to represent eternal destruction are found in Revelation and Ezekiel.
