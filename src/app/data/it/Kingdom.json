Often the kingship was hereditary. The sovereign ruler might bear other titles such as Pharaoh or Caesar.Kingdoms of ancient times, as today, had various symbols of royalty. There was generally a capital city or place of the king&#x2019;s residence, a royal court, a standing army (though perhaps quite reduced in size in times of peace). The word &#x201C;kingdom,&#x201D; as used in the Bible, does not of itself reveal anything definite as to the governmental structure, the territorial extent, or the authority of the monarch. Kingdoms ranged in size and influence from the mighty world powers such as Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, on down to small city-kingdoms such as those in Canaan at the time of the Israelite conquest. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002614/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 12:7-24</a>) The governmental structure also might vary considerably from kingdom to kingdom.The first kingdom of human history, that of Nimrod, seems to have been initially a city-kingdom, later extending its realm to include other cities, its base remaining at Babel. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002614/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:9-11</a>) Salem, over which King-Priest Melchizedek ruled in the first kingdom with divine approval, was also apparently a city-kingdom.

Larger kingdoms embraced an entire region, such as the kingdoms of Edom, Moab, and Ammon. The great empires, ruling vast areas and having other kingdoms tributary to them, generally seem to have arisen or grown out of small city-states or tribal groups that eventually combined under a dominant leader. Such coalitions were sometimes of a temporary nature, often formed for war against a common foe.
