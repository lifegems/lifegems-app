Both of these words were used to mean missing or failing to reach not merely physical objects or goals (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Job 5:24</a>) but also moral or intellectual goals or marks. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 8:35, 36</a> says the one finding godly wisdom finds life, but the &#x2018;one missing [from Heb., <em>cha&#xB7;ta&#x2BC;&#x2B9;</em>] wisdom is doing violence to his soul,&#x2019; leading to death. In the Scriptures both the Hebrew and Greek terms refer mainly to sinning on the part of God&#x2019;s intelligent creatures, their missing the mark with regard to their Creator.<strong>Man&#x2019;s Place in God&#x2019;s Purpose. </strong>Man was created in &#x201C;God&#x2019;s image.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:26,&#xA0;27</a>) He, like all other created things, existed and was created because of God&#x2019;s will.

Sin, thus, involves a moral <em>failure, </em>a missing of the mark, in all these aspects.<strong>The Introduction of Sin. </strong>Sin occurred first in the spirit realm before its introduction on earth. For unknown ages full harmony with God prevailed in the universe. Disruption came through a spirit creature referred to simply as the Resister, Adversary (Heb., <em>Sa&#xB7;tan&#x2B9;; </em>Gr., <em>Sa&#xB7;ta&#xB7;nas&#x2B9;; </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Job 1:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/22/1\" data-bid=\"23-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 16:20</a>), the principal False Accuser or Slanderer (Gr., <em>Di&#xB7;a&#x2B9;bo&#xB7;los</em>) of God.

John&#x2019;s words show that, once having introduced sin, Satan continued his sinful course. Hence, any person that &#x201C;makes sin his business or practice&#x201D; reveals himself to be a &#x2018;child&#x2019; of the Adversary, spiritual offspring reflecting the qualities of his &#x201C;father.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Expositor&#x2019;s Greek Testament, </em>edited by W.&#xA0;R.&#xA0;Nicoll, 1967, Vol.&#xA0;V, p.&#xA0;185; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 8:44;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/26/1\" data-bid=\"27-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Jo 3:10-12</a>.Since cultivation of wrong desire to the point of fertility precedes the &#x2018;birth of sin&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 1:14,&#xA0;15</a>), the spirit creature who turned opposer had already begun to deviate from righteousness, had experienced disaffection toward God, prior to the actual <em>manifestation </em>of sin.<strong><em>Revolt in Eden. </em></strong>God&#x2019;s will as expressed to Adam and his wife was primarily positive, setting forth things they were to do. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 1:26-29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/28/1\" data-bid=\"29-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:15</a>) One prohibitive command was given to Adam, that forbidding eating of (or even touching) the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:16, 17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/29/1\" data-bid=\"30-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:2,&#xA0;3</a>) God&#x2019;s test of man&#x2019;s obedience and devotion is notable for the respect it showed for man&#x2019;s dignity. By it God attributed nothing bad to Adam; he did not use as a test the prohibition of, for example, bestiality, murder, or some similar vile or base act, thereby implying that God felt Adam might have some despicable inclinations residing within him. Eating was normal, proper, and Adam had been told to &#x201C;eat to satisfaction&#x201D; of what God had given him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:16</a>) But God now tested Adam by restricting his eating of the fruit of this one tree, God thus causing the eating of that fruit to symbolize that the eater comes to a knowledge that enables him to decide for himself what is &#x201C;good&#x201D; or what is &#x201C;bad&#x201D; for man. Thus, God neither imposed a hardship on the man nor did He attribute to Adam anything beneath his dignity as a human son of God.The woman was the first human sinner. Her temptation by God&#x2019;s Adversary, who employed a serpent as a medium of communication (see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/1\">PERFECTION</a> [The first sinner and the king of Tyre]), was not through an open appeal to immorality of a sensual nature. Rather, it paraded as an appeal to the desire for supposed intellectual elevation and freedom. After first getting Eve to restate God&#x2019;s law, which she evidently had received through her husband, the Tempter then made an assault on God&#x2019;s truthfulness and goodness. He asserted that eating fruit from the prescribed tree would result, not in death, but in enlightenment and godlike ability to determine for oneself whether a thing was good or bad. This statement reveals that the Tempter was by now thoroughly alienated in heart from his Creator, his words constituting open contradiction plus veiled slander of God. He did not accuse God of unknowing error but of deliberate misrepresentation of matters, saying, &#x201C;For God knows&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#x201D; The gravity of sin, the detestable nature of such disaffection, is seen in the means to which this spirit son stooped to achieve his ends, becoming a deceitful liar and an ambition-driven murderer, since he obviously knew the fatal consequences of what he now suggested to his human listener.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/31/1\" data-bid=\"32-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 8:44</a>.As the account reveals, improper desire began to work in the woman. Instead of reacting in utter disgust and righteous indignation on hearing the righteousness of God&#x2019;s law thus called into question, she now came to look upon the tree as desirable. She coveted what rightly belonged to Jehovah God as her Sovereign<wbr>&#x2014;his ability and prerogative to determine what is good and what is bad for his creatures. Hence, she was now starting to conform herself to the ways, standards, and will of the opposer, who contradicted her Creator as well as her God-appointed head, her husband. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 11:3</a>) Putting trust in the Tempter&#x2019;s words, she let herself be seduced, ate of the fruit, and thus revealed the sin that had been born in her heart and mind.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Co 11:3</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 1:14, 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/34/1\" data-bid=\"35-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 5:27,&#xA0;28</a>.Adam later partook of the fruit when it was offered to him by his wife. The apostle shows that the man&#x2019;s sinning differed from that of his wife in that Adam was not deceived by the Tempter&#x2019;s propaganda, hence he put no stock in the claim that eating the fruit from the tree could be done with impunity. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 2:14</a>) Adam&#x2019;s eating, therefore, must have been due to desire for his wife, and he &#x2018;listened to her voice&#x2019; rather than to that <span id=\"page964\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"964\" data-before-text=\"964\"></span>of his God. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/36/1\" data-bid=\"37-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;17</a>) He thus conformed to her ways and will, and through her, to those of God&#x2019;s Adversary. He therefore &#x2018;missed the mark,&#x2019; failed to act in God&#x2019;s image and likeness, did not reflect God&#x2019;s glory, and, in fact, insulted his heavenly Father.<strong>Effects of Sin. </strong>Sin put man out of harmony with his Creator. It thereby damaged not only his relations with God but also his relations with the rest of God&#x2019;s creation, including damage to man&#x2019;s own self, to his mind, heart, and body. It brought consequences of enormous evil upon the human race.The conduct of the human pair immediately revealed this disharmony. Their covering portions of their divinely made bodies and thereafter their attempting to hide themselves from God were clear evidences of the alienation that had taken place within their minds and hearts. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:7,&#xA0;8</a>) Sin thus caused them to feel guilt, anxiety, insecurity, shame. This illustrates the point made by the apostle at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 2:15</a>, that God&#x2019;s law was &#x2018;written on man&#x2019;s heart&#x2019;; hence a violation of that law now produced an internal upheaval within man, his conscience accusing him of wrongdoing. In effect, man had a built-in lie detector that made impossible his concealing his sinful state from his Creator; and God, responding to the man&#x2019;s excuse for his changed attitude toward his heavenly Father, promptly inquired: &#x201C;From the tree from which I commanded you not to eat have you eaten?&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:9-11</a>.To be true to himself, as well as for the good of the rest of his universal family, Jehovah God could not countenance such a sinful course, on the part of either his human creatures or the spirit son turned rebel. Maintaining his holiness, he justly imposed the sentence of death on them all. The human pair were then expelled from God&#x2019;s garden in Eden, hence cut off from access to that other tree designated by God as &#x201C;the tree of life.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 3:14-24</a>.<strong><em>Results to mankind as a whole. </em></strong><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 5:12</a> states that &#x201C;through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 1:8-10</a>.) Some have explained this as meaning that all of Adam&#x2019;s future offspring shared in Adam&#x2019;s initial act of sin because, as their family head, he represented them and thereby made them, in effect, participants with him in his sin. The apostle, however, speaks of death as &#x2018;spreading&#x2019; to all men, which implies a progressive rather than a simultaneous effect on Adam&#x2019;s descendants.Additionally, the apostle goes on to speak of death as ruling as king &#x201C;from Adam down to Moses, <em>even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression by Adam.&#x201D; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:14</a>) Adam&#x2019;s sin is rightly called a &#x201C;transgression&#x201D; since it was an overstepping of a stated law, an express command of God to him. Also, when Adam sinned, it was of his own free choice, as a perfect human who was free from disabilities. Clearly, his offspring have never enjoyed that state of perfection. So, these factors seem out of harmony with the view that &#x2018;when Adam sinned, all of his as yet unborn descendants sinned with him.&#x2019; For all of Adam&#x2019;s descendants to be held accountable as participants in Adam&#x2019;s personal sin would require some expression of <em>will </em>on their part as to having him as their family head. Yet none of them in reality willed to be born of him, their birth into the Adamic line resulting from the fleshly will of their parents.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:13</a>.The evidence, then, points to a passing on of sin from Adam to succeeding generations as a result of the recognized law of heredity.

From him, as well as from Eve, his offspring would inescapably inherit not merely physical characteristics but also personality traits, including the inclination toward sin.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 15:22,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> 48,&#xA0;49</a>.Paul&#x2019;s words also point to this conclusion when he says that &#x201C;just as through the disobedience of the one man [Adam] many were constituted sinners, likewise also through the obedience of the one person [Christ Jesus] many will be constituted righteous.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:19</a>) Those to be &#x201C;constituted righteous&#x201D; by Christ&#x2019;s obedience were not all immediately so constituted at the moment of his presenting his ransom sacrifice to God, but they progressively come under the benefits of that sacrifice as they come to exercise faith in that provision and become reconciled to God.

What, then, shall we say? Is the Law sin? Never may that become so! Really I would not have come to know sin if it had not been for the Law; and, for example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said: &#x2018;You must not covet.&#x2019; But sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004132/88/0\" data-bid=\"89-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 7:5-8</a>.Without the Law, the apostle Paul would not have known or discerned the full range or scope of sin, for example, the sinfulness of covetousness. As the apostle notes, the Law &#x201C;excited&#x201D; sinful passion, and the commandment against coveting provided an &#x201C;inducement&#x201D; for sin. This is to be understood in the light of Paul&#x2019;s statement that &#x201C;apart from law sin was dead.&#x201D; As long as sin had not been defined specifically, a person could not be accused of committing sins that were not legally identified as such. Before the Law came, Paul and others of his nation lived uncondemned for sins that were not specified. With the introduction of the Law, however, Paul and his fellow countrymen were designated as sinners under condemnation of death. The Law made them more conscious of being sinners.
