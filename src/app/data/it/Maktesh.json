(<em>AT, JB, RS</em>) The Targum identifies Maktesh with the Kidron Valley, the deep ravine along Jerusalem&#x2019;s eastern wall. But this valley is not in the vicinity of the more westerly &#x201C;Fish Gate&#x201D; and the &#x201C;second <span id=\"page298\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"298\" data-before-text=\"298\"></span>quarter.&#x201D; For this reason Maktesh is generally thought to denote a part of the Central (Tyropoeon) Valley, perhaps its upper portion."}
