The territory of the tribe of Manasseh evidently was to embrace this area, but the record shows that the Israelites did not dispossess the inhabitants of that land, so &#x2018;they kept dwelling in the midst of Israel.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002803/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">De 3:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002803/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> Jos 13:13</a>) Generally associated with the neighboring kingdom of Geshur, Maacah appears to have been located to the N of that kingdom and to have bordered on the region of Bashan. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002803/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 12:5</a>) It is usually considered to have occupied the area running from the southern slopes of Mount Hermon down to the Hula Basin and from the Jordan River eastward to the edge of the Syrian Desert, or, basically, the northern part of the present district of Golan.Maacah was an Aramaean (Syrian) kingdom, its people perhaps descending from Nahor&#x2019;s son of the same name. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002803/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002803/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 19:6</a>) When the Ammonites went to war against King David, they hired the services of the king of Maacah, along with others. The small number of troops provided by Maacah, as compared with those of the other allies, may indicate the small size of the Maacathite kingdom. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002803/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 10:6-8</a>) Joab&#x2019;s victory over the Ammonites and their Syrian allies was followed up by a further victory over the Syrians by King David. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002803/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 10:13-19</a>) From later accounts it seems likely that the kingdom of Maacah eventually came under the domination of the kingdom of Damascus."}
