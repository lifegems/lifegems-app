(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 3:2</a>) He was the son-in-law of High Priest Annas (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 18:13</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/0\">ANNAS</a>) and was appointed to office by the predecessor of Pontius Pilate, Valerius Gratus, about the year 18&#xA0;C.E., although some say as late as the year 26&#xA0;C.E. He held the office until about the year 36&#xA0;C.E., longer than any of his immediate predecessors, this being due to his skillful diplomacy and cooperation with Roman rule. He and Pilate were reportedly good friends. Caiaphas was a Sadducee.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 5:17</a>.A ringleader in the plot to do away with Jesus, Caiaphas prophesied, though not of his own originality, that Jesus would shortly die for the nation, <span id=\"page386\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"386\" data-before-text=\"386\"></span>and to that end he gave his wholehearted support. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 11:49-53;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:12-14</a>) At Jesus&#x2019; trial before the Sanhedrin, Caiaphas ripped his garments and said: &#x201C;He has blasphemed!&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:65</a>) When Jesus was before Pilate, Caiaphas was undoubtedly there crying: &#x201C;Impale him! Impale him!&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;11</a>); he was there asking for the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 27:20, 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 15:11</a>); he was there shouting: &#x201C;We have no king but Caesar&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:15</a>); he was also there protesting the sign over Jesus&#x2019; head: &#x201C;The King of the Jews&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:21</a>).The death of Jesus did not mark the end of Caiaphas&#x2019; role as a chief persecutor of infant Christianity. The apostles were next haled before this religious ruler; they were sternly commanded to stop their preaching, were threatened, and were even flogged, but to no avail. &#x201C;Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup,&#x201D; Caiaphas notwithstanding. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 4:5-7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 5:17, 18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 21,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/9/3\" data-bid=\"10-4\" class=\"b\"> 27, 28,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/9/4\" data-bid=\"10-5\" class=\"b\"> 40,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/9/5\" data-bid=\"10-6\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;42</a>) The blood of righteous Stephen was soon added to Jesus&#x2019; bloodstains on the skirts of Caiaphas, who also armed Saul of Tarsus with letters of introduction so the murderous campaign could be extended to Damascus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 7:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 54-60;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000856/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:1,&#xA0;2</a>) However, not long thereafter Vitellius, a Roman official, removed Caiaphas from office."}
