They are native to parts of Africa and Asia. The Hebrew term for frankincense (<em>levoh&#xB7;nah&#x2B9; </em>or <em>levo&#xB7;nah&#x2B9;</em>) comes from a root meaning &#x201C;be white&#x201D; and is evidently drawn from its milky color. The Greek <em>li&#x2B9;ba&#xB7;nos </em>is derived from the Hebrew.The Song of Solomon mentions &#x201C;the hill of frankincense,&#x201D; apparently in a figurative way, but may indicate the cultivation of incense trees in Solomon&#x2019;s royal parks. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 4:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 12-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Ec 2:5</a>) Frankincense was a principal item carried by the caravans of Oriental traders who traveled the spice routes out of S Arabia up to Gaza near the Mediterranean and to Damascus. Scriptural references indicated it was imported in this way into Palestine from Sheba.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 60:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 6:20</a>.Frankincense is obtained by making successive <span id=\"page870\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"870\" data-before-text=\"870\"></span>incisions in the bark or by peeling off the bark at intervals, causing a white juice (after several incisions it is spotted with yellow or red) to flow and form into tears of about 2.5&#xA0;cm (1&#xA0;in.) in length. When gathered, the frankincense consists of a fragrant gum resin in small chunks, or beads, that have a bitter taste and produce an aromatic odor when burned.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 3:6</a>.Aside from the references in The Song of Solomon, frankincense is regularly mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures in connection with worship. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 2:14-16</a>.)

But it was not to be included on sin offerings (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Le 5:11</a>) or on the &#x201C;grain offering of jealousy.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001565/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 5:15</a>) This was doubtless because the latter offerings had to do with sin, or error, and were not offered up as a sacrifice of praise or thanksgiving to Jehovah.Frankincense is mentioned as being stored in the rebuilt temple buildings, following the return from Babylonian exile.
