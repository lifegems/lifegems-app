The bulbul characteristically has a short neck, short wings, and a long tail. While many translations render <em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;ghur&#x2B9; </em>as &#x201C;crane,&#x201D; Hezekiah&#x2019;s reference to the bird&#x2019;s &#x201C;chirping&#x201D; would hardly describe the deep trumpeting sound made by that large bird. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000837/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 38:14</a>) <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros </em>(by L.&#xA0;Koehler and W.&#xA0;Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;679) identified <em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;ghur&#x2B9; </em>as the bulbul (<em>Pycnonotus Reichenovi</em>). Ludwig Koehler says the Hebrew <em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;ghur&#x2B9; </em>describes a bird that &#x2018;ruffles or bristles its feathers&#x2019; and says concerning the bulbul that &#x201C;during the pauses (of its song) it lifts .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. from time to time the extended crestlike feathers of the back of the head.&#x201D; (<em>Kleine Lichter </em>[German], Zurich, 1945, pp.&#xA0;38,&#xA0;39) Unlike the somewhat bellowing sound of the crane, the song of the bulbul is rather flutelike in tone and is described as a combination chirp and warble.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000837/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah (8:7</a>) evidently refers to the seasonal arrival of migratory birds in his censuring the Israelites for not discerning the time of God&#x2019;s judgment on them."}
