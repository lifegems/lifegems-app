(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000849/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 45:11</a>) If the bath measure is to be viewed as having a capacity of 22&#xA0;L (5.81 gal; 4.99 dry gal), as archaeological evidence seems to indicate, then the cab measure would have a capacity of 1.22&#xA0;L (2.58 liquid pt; 2.2 dry pt)."}
