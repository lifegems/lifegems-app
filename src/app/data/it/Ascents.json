Four of these psalms are attributed to David and one to Solomon. The exact meaning of the superscription is a subject of discussion.At one time Jewish tradition (Mishnah, <em>Middot </em>2:5) held that these 15 songs were sung by the Levites in ascending the 15 steps from the Court of Women to the Court of Israel at the temple in Jerusalem, but this view is generally discounted today. Some suggest that the phrase refers to the exalted contents of these psalms, though there seems to be little reason thus to elevate them above the other inspired psalms. Most commentators believe the title derives from the use of these psalms by the Israelite worshipers when traveling or ascending to the lofty city of Jerusalem situated high in the mountains of Judah as they joyfully attended the three great annual festivals there.
