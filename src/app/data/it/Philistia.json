The sand dunes along the coast penetrate the land for a considerable distance, sometimes for as much as 6&#xA0;km (3.5&#xA0;mi). Apart from this, the region is fertile and supports grain, olive groves, and fruit trees.During a major part of the Hebrew Scripture period, the Philistines occupied the coastal plain and were among Israel&#x2019;s avowed enemies.

Just when this migration began is uncertain. However, as early as the time of Abraham and his son Isaac, Philistines resided at Gerar in southern Canaan. They had a king, Abimelech, and an army under the command of a certain Phicol.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 20:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 21:32-34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 26:1-18</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/5\">ABIMELECH</a> Nos.&#xA0;1 and&#xA0;2.Some object to the Genesis references to Philistine residence in Canaan, arguing that the Philistines did not settle there until the 12th&#xA0;century B.C.E. But this objection does not rest on a solid basis. The <em>New Bible Dictionary </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Douglas (1985, p.&#xA0;933) observes: &#x201C;Since the Philistines are not named in extra-biblical inscriptions until the 12th&#xA0;century BC, and the archaeological remains associated with them do not appear before this time, many commentators reject references to them in the patriarchal period as anachronistic.&#x201D; However, in showing why such a position is not sound, mention is made of the evidence of a major expansion of Aegean trade reaching back to about the 20th&#xA0;century B.C.E. It is pointed out that a particular group&#x2019;s not being prominent enough to be mentioned in the inscriptions of other nations does not prove that the group did not exist. The conclusion reached in that <em>New Bible Dictionary </em>is: &#x201C;There is no reason why small groups of Philistines could not have been among the early Aegean traders, not prominent enough to be noticed by the larger states.&#x201D;When Israel left Egypt in 1513&#xA0;B.C.E., Jehovah chose not to lead the Israelites by way of Philistia (the most direct route from Egypt to the Promised Land), lest they become discouraged because of immediate warfare and decide to return to Egypt. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 13:17</a>) The Philistines likely would not view the approach of millions of Israelites as mere international traffic, which normally flowed through their land. They were then a settled people, whereas the Sinai region to which Jehovah directed Israel had largely nomadic tribes and many unsettled regions into which Israel could enter without provoking immediate conflict.At the time aged Joshua apportioned the land W of the Jordan, the Philistine territories were still untouched by the conquest. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:2,&#xA0;3</a>) Later, however, the men of Judah did capture three of the main Philistine cities, Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron. But this was only a partial victory, for Judah &#x201C;could not dispossess the inhabitants of the low plain, because they had war chariots with iron scythes.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:18,&#xA0;19</a>.<strong><em>In the time of Judges. </em></strong>For years thereafter, the continuance of the Philistines and other peoples in Canaan served to test Israel&#x2019;s obedience to Jehovah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 3:3,&#xA0;4</a>) Time and again they failed the test by adopting false worship.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 2:18</a>) One of these judges, Shamgar, struck down 600 Philistines using a mere cattle goad.

While he was serving at the tabernacle in Shiloh during the final part of High Priest Eli&#x2019;s judgeship, the Philistines struck down about 4,000 Israelites in the area of Aphek and Ebenezer. The Israelites then had the sacred Ark brought to the battlefield, thinking that this would bring them victory. The Philistines intensified their efforts. Thirty thousand Israelites were slain, and the Ark was captured. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 4:1-11</a>) The Philistines took the Ark to the temple of their god Dagon at Ashdod. Twice the image of this god fell on its face. The second time the idol itself was broken. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 5:1-5</a>) The Ark was then passed from one Philistine city to another. Wherever it went, there came to be panic and pestilence. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 5:6-12</a>) Finally, seven months after the capture, the Ark was returned to Israel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 6:1-21</a>.Some 20 years later (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 7:2</a>), the Philistines marched against the Israelites who were, at Samuel&#x2019;s direction, assembled at Mizpah for worship. This time Jehovah threw the Philistines into confusion, enabling his people to subdue them. Later, &#x201C;the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel kept coming back to Israel from Ekron to Gath.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 7:5-14</a>.<strong><em>Saul&#x2019;s reign until subjugation by David. </em></strong>However, this did not end Israel&#x2019;s difficulties with the Philistines.

(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 10:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> 13:1-3</a>.) The Philistines were strong enough to prohibit the Israelites from having their own smiths, thereby <span id=\"page633\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"633\" data-before-text=\"633\"></span>keeping them disarmed. This also forced the Israelites to go to them to have their agricultural implements sharpened. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 13:19-22</a>) The situation was so severe that even Hebrews sided with the Philistines against fellow Israelites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 14:21</a>) Nevertheless, with Jehovah&#x2019;s help, Saul&#x2019;s first major campaign against the Philistines resulted in Israel&#x2019;s striking them down from Michmash to Aijalon.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 13:1&#x2013;14:31</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/6\">MICHMAS(H)</a>.Later, upon recovering from this defeat, the Philistines assembled their forces to fight against Israel. The two armies took their position on opposite sides of the Low Plain of Elah, in Judah. Morning and evening, for 40 days, the warrior Goliath emerged from the Philistine camp, challenging Israel to supply a man to fight him in single combat. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:1-10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/31/1\" data-bid=\"32-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;16</a>) This challenge was answered by the shepherd David, who struck Goliath to the earth with a stone from his sling and used Goliath&#x2019;s own sword to put him to death. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:48-51</a>) The Israelites then pursued the fleeing Philistines, striking them down as far as the cities of Gath and Ekron.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:52,&#xA0;53</a>.Thereafter David continued waging successful warfare against the Philistines. When he would return from battle, the women, in celebration of the victory, would say: &#x201C;Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:5-7</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:25-27,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/35/1\" data-bid=\"36-2\" class=\"b\"> 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/35/2\" data-bid=\"36-3\" class=\"b\"> 19:8</a>.) This caused Saul to become jealous of David, finally resulting in David&#x2019;s having to run for his life. He fled to the Philistine city of Gath. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:8,&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/36/1\" data-bid=\"37-2\" class=\"b\"> 20:33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/36/2\" data-bid=\"37-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:10</a>) There the servants of King Achish appear to have sought David&#x2019;s death. But by disguising his sanity, he was able to leave the city unharmed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 21:10-15</a>) Sometime thereafter David, though still pursued by Saul, saved the Judean city of Keilah from Philistine pillagers. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 23:1-12</a>) A later Philistine raid in Israelite territory forced Saul to turn back temporarily from chasing David.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 23:27, 28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/39/1\" data-bid=\"40-2\" class=\"b\"> 24:1,&#xA0;2</a>.Because of continually being hunted by Saul, David again decided to take refuge in Philistine territory. Received favorably by King Achish of Gath, David was given the city of Ziklag. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 27:1-6</a>) A year or two later, when the Philistines were preparing to fight against Saul&#x2019;s forces, King Achish, believing that David had become &#x201C;a stench among his people Israel,&#x201D; invited him to go along. But the other Philistine axis lords did not trust David, and at their insistence, he and his men returned to Philistia. In the ensuing conflict with Israel, the Philistines gained a decisive victory and Saul and three of his sons perished.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 27:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/41/1\" data-bid=\"42-2\" class=\"b\"> 28:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/41/2\" data-bid=\"42-3\" class=\"b\"> 29:1-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/41/3\" data-bid=\"42-4\" class=\"b\"> 31:1-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/41/4\" data-bid=\"42-5\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 10:1-10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/41/5\" data-bid=\"42-6\" class=\"b\"> 13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/41/6\" data-bid=\"42-7\" class=\"b\"> 12:19</a>.When David was finally anointed as king over all Israel, the Philistines invaded the Low Plain of Rephaim (SW of Jerusalem) but suffered humiliating defeat.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Joe 3:4-8</a>) Since the words of the prophet Joel appear to have been recorded in the ninth century B.C.E., the defeats of the Philistines at the hands of Uzziah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 26:6-8</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:8</a>) could have been included in the fulfillment of this prophecy.<span id=\"page634\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"634\" data-before-text=\"634\"></span>However, a larger fulfillment evidently came after the Israelites returned from Babylonian exile. Notes commentator C.&#xA0;F.&#xA0;Keil: &#x201C;Alexander the Great and his successors set many of the Jewish prisoners of war in their lands at liberty (compare the promise of King Demetrius to Jonathan, &#x2018;I will send away in freedom such of the Judaeans as have been made prisoners, and reduced to slavery in our land,&#x2019; Josephus, <em>Ant. </em>xiii. 2,&#xA0;3), and portions of the Philistian and Phoenician lands were for a time under Jewish sway.&#x201D; (<em>Commentary on the Old Testament, </em>1973, Vol.&#xA0;X, Joel, p.&#xA0;224) (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Ob 19,&#xA0;20</a>.) Noteworthy, too, is the fact that Alexander the Great took the Philistine city of Gaza. Many of the inhabitants were slain, and the survivors were sold into slavery. A number of other prophecies likewise pointed to the execution of Jehovah&#x2019;s vengeance upon the Philistines.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 14:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/58/1\" data-bid=\"59-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 25:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/58/2\" data-bid=\"59-3\" class=\"b\"> 20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/58/3\" data-bid=\"59-4\" class=\"b\"> 47:1-7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/58/4\" data-bid=\"59-5\" class=\"b\"> Eze 25:15, 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/58/5\" data-bid=\"59-6\" class=\"b\"> Am 1:6-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/58/6\" data-bid=\"59-7\" class=\"b\"> Zep 2:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/58/7\" data-bid=\"59-8\" class=\"b\"> Zec 9:5-7</a>; for details see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/7\">ASHDOD</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/8\">ASHKELON</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/9\">EKRON</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/10\">GATH</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/11\">GAZA</a> No.&#xA0;1.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 16:27</a>, &#x201C;the daughters of the Philistines&#x201D; are depicted as being humiliated on account of Jerusalem&#x2019;s loose conduct.
