At times &#x201C;scepter&#x201D; is used in a figurative sense to represent kings (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 19:10, 11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;14</a>) or authority (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 10:11</a>), especially royal authority.In ancient Persia, unless the monarch held out the golden scepter, anyone who appeared uninvited before the king was put to death.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Es 4:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 5:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 8:4</a>.Jacob&#x2019;s prophetic words that &#x2018;the scepter would not turn aside from Judah&#x2019; indicated that the kingship would come to be the possession of the tribe of Judah and would remain such until Shiloh came. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:10</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/0\">COMMANDER&#x2019;S STAFF</a>.) Centuries later the Babylonians, acting as Jehovah&#x2019;s executional &#x201C;sword,&#x201D; destroyed the kingdom of Judah and took its king captive. This is alluded to by Jehovah&#x2019;s words through Ezekiel: &#x201C;A sword, a sword! It has been sharpened, and it is also polished. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Is it rejecting the scepter of my own son, as it does every tree? .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. For an extermination has been made, and what of it if it is rejecting also the scepter?&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 21:9, 10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>) Thus the &#x201C;sword&#x201D; treated the Judean &#x201C;scepter&#x201D; of the Davidic dynasty like every tree (to be chopped down) or like other kings or kingdoms that it brought to ruin.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 2</a>, a prophecy that Peter applied to Jesus Christ (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 4:25-27</a>), showed that Jehovah&#x2019;s anointed one would use an iron scepter to break the nations to pieces. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 2:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Re 12:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:15</a>.) As Jesus Christ always uses his royal authority in the right way, his scepter is one of uprightness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 45:6,&#xA0;7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 1:8,&#xA0;9</a>.<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003854/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 125:3</a> states that &#x201C;the scepter of wickedness will not keep resting upon the lot of the righteous ones.&#x201D; These words give assurance that the righteous will not always be oppressed by those who exercise authority in a wicked way."}
