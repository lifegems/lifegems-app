Jesus pronounced coming &#x201C;woe&#x201D; for the Jewish inhabitants of Chorazin who, during that period, were witnesses of &#x201C;powerful works&#x201D; that would have moved the pagans of Tyre and Sidon to repentance, and yet who failed to act on Jesus&#x2019; message. After this, in the fall of 32&#xA0;C.E., when dispatching the 70 disciples during his later Judean ministry, Jesus inserted a reference to Chorazin&#x2019;s impenitent attitude into his discussion apparently to emphasize that great woe would be experienced by the unresponsive cities against which his disciples were to &#x2018;wipe the dust&#x2019; off their feet.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000965/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 10:10-16</a>."}
