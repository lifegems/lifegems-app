(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004350/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 19:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004350/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 37:12</a>) Sennacherib boasted, through his messengers, that the gods worshiped by the people of these places had been unable to deliver them from the power of his forefathers. Because of the reference to &#x201C;the sons of Eden,&#x201D; Tel-assar is generally associated with the small kingdom of Bit-adini along the Upper Euphrates. Assyrian monarchs Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III and Esar-haddon both refer to a Til-Ashuri, but its location is considered to have been near the Assyrian border of Elam. Hence, identification of Tel-assar remains uncertain."}
