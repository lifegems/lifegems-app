Its inhabitants are generally thought to have been designated by the Hebrew term <em>Lu&#xB7;vim&#x2B9;. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 12:3</a>; &#x201C;Libyans,&#x201D; <em>LXX, NW, RS</em>) If <em>Lu&#xB7;vim&#x2B9; </em>is a variant of <em>Leha&#xB7;vim&#x2B9; </em>(Lehabim), this may indicate that at least some of the Libyans descended from Ham through Mizraim. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:13</a>) The traditional Jewish view found in the writings of Josephus (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>I, 130-132 [vi,&#xA0;2]) makes the Libyans descendants of Ham through Put. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 10:6</a>) Also, the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>and the Latin <em>Vulgate </em>read &#x201C;Libyans&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 46:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> Ezekiel 27:10</a>, and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">38:5</a> where the Hebrew text says &#x201C;Put.&#x201D; It is possible, of course, that descendants of both Put and Mizraim settled in the geographic region of northern Africa that came to be called Libya. This would mean that the designation &#x201C;Libyans&#x201D; is more comprehensive than the Hebrew term <em>Lu&#xB7;vim&#x2B9;.</em>Egypt&#x2019;s King Shishak, regarded as the founder of the &#x201C;Libyan dynasty,&#x201D; captured numerous cities when he invaded Judah in the fifth year of King Rehoboam (993&#xA0;B.C.E.). His powerful force of chariots and horsemen included Libyans. Although Jerusalem itself was spared, Shishak stripped the city of its treasures. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 14:25, 26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 12:2-9</a>) About 26 years later (967&#xA0;B.C.E.), the Libyans were represented among the troops of Zerah the Ethiopian, which penetrated Judah but suffered humiliating defeat. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 14:9-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:8</a>) In the seventh century B.C.E., the assistance of the Libyans and others was seemingly of no avail in saving the Egyptian city of No-amon from calamity at the hands of the Assyrians. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Na 3:7-10</a>) It was foretold that the Libyans and Ethiopians would be at the &#x201C;steps&#x201D; of the &#x201C;king of the north,&#x201D; implying that these former supporters of Egypt would come under his control.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Da 11:43</a>.In the year 33&#xA0;C.E., among the Jews and proselytes at Jerusalem for the Festival of Pentecost were persons from &#x201C;the parts of Libya, which is toward Cyrene,&#x201D; that is, the western part of Libya. Likely some of these were baptized in response to Peter&#x2019;s discourse and later carried the message of Christianity back to the land of their residence.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002737/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:10</a>."}
