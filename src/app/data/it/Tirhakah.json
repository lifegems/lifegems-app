(For evidence favoring Biblical chronology over the secular, see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004422/0\">CHRONOLOGY</a> [Bible Chronology and Secular History].) During Hezekiah&#x2019;s reign, while Assyrian King Sennacherib was fighting against Libnah, news came that Tirhakah, the Ethiopian king of Egypt, was on his way to fight the Assyrians. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004422/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 19:8,&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004422/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 37:8,&#xA0;9</a>) An Assyrian inscription, though not mentioning Tirhakah, indicates that Sennacherib defeated the forces that came from Egypt and captured &#x201C;the charioteers of the king of Ethiopia.&#x201D; The next Assyrian king, Esar-haddon, boasted about his conquest of Egypt, saying: &#x201C;Its king, Tirhakah, I wounded five times with arrowshots and ruled over his entire country.&#x201D; During the reign of Esar-haddon&#x2019;s son and successor Ashurbanipal, Tirhakah revolted against submission to Assyria. But, according to Ashurbanipal, &#x201C;the terror of the (sacred) weapon of Ashur, my lord, overcame Tirhakah where he had taken refuge and he was never heard of again.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, </em>edited by J.&#xA0;Pritchard, 1974, pp.&#xA0;287, 288, 290, 295."}
