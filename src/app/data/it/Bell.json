This instrument is usually pear-shaped or cuplike, and gives a dominant musical note when struck.The first mention of bells in the Bible is in connection with the tabernacle service in the book of Exodus, where the Hebrew word <em>pa&#xB7;&#x2BD;amohn&#x2B9; </em>occurs seven times. On the hem of the solid-blue coat of the high priest were attached golden bells alternated with pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet material.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000625/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 28:33-35;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000625/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 39:25,&#xA0;26</a>.In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000625/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Zechariah 14:20</a> the Hebrew word <em>metsil&#xB7;lah&#x2B9; </em>is used to denote the bells attached to the harnesses of horses.
