It is vital for the maintenance of human life and health. Being fully aware of the importance of rest, Jesus Christ was concerned about his disciples&#x2019; having time to rest up a bit. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 6:31</a>) Jesus&#x2019; example shows that, even in human perfection, rest and sleep are necessary.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 4:38</a>.Hard work (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 5:12</a>), a clear conscience (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 32:3-5</a>), and freedom from undue anxiety as well as trust in Jehovah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 3:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 4:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> Pr 3:24-26</a>) contribute much toward making an individual&#x2019;s sleep pleasurable and refreshing.

If not due to sickness or other adverse or trialsome circumstances, their sleeplessness may stem from concern for fellow believers and the advancement of true worship.

However, they do not need to worry needlessly about material possessions and lose sleep as a result. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 5:12</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:25-34</a>.) On the other hand, wrongdoing serves to make wicked persons content. &#x201C;They do not sleep unless they do badness, and their sleep has been snatched away unless they cause someone to stumble.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 4:16</a>.While sleep is important, a person should not become a lover of sleep.

His servants, therefore, can rest assured that he can at all times supply needed help.

The night is well along; the day has drawn near. Let us therefore put off the works belonging to darkness and let us put on the weapons of the light. As in the daytime let us walk decently, not in revelries and drunken bouts, not in illicit intercourse and loose conduct, not in strife and jealousy.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 13:11-13</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 5:6-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Th 5:6-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/18/2\" data-bid=\"19-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 16:15</a>.) Those who engage in wrong practices or advance false teachings are asleep as to righteousness and need to wake up if they are to gain God&#x2019;s approval.<strong>Death Compared With Sleep. </strong>There is evidence that people sleep in cycles. Each cycle is made up of a deep sleep followed by a lighter sleep. During periods of deep sleep it is very difficult to awaken a person. He is completely unaware of his surroundings and the things that may be occurring about him. There is no conscious activity. Similarly, the dead are &#x201C;conscious of nothing at all.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 9:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> Ps 146:4</a>) Therefore death, whether that of a man or of an animal, is like sleep.

Also, this girl had not been buried, nor had her body had time to begin decaying, as had the body of Lazarus.
