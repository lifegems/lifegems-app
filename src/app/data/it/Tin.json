Of the six products of the ancient metallurgist&#x2019;s furnace, tin had the lowest melting point of all, only 232&#xB0; C. (449&#xB0; F.). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004418/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 22:18,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004418/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;20</a>) The original Hebrew word <em>bedhil&#x2B9; </em>means &#x201C;that which is separated or divided,&#x201D; that is, from precious metals by smelting; it is also translated &#x201C;waste products.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004418/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 1:25</a>.There were no tin mines in Palestine. The first reference to tin, soon after the Exodus, includes it among the valuable spoils of war taken from the Midianites.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004418/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:12</a>) Much of the heavy dark oxide of tin called cassiterite came from river sands in Spain and England. Tin, it appears, was used to make plummets, for at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004418/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Zechariah 4:10</a> (which speaks of &#x201C;the plummet&#x201D;) the Masoretic text reads, &#x201C;the stone [or, weight], the tin.&#x201D; In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004418/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Amos 7:7, 8</a> the Hebrew word translated &#x201C;plummet&#x201D; may mean tin or lead. Tin&#x2019;s greatest usefulness, however, was as a hardening agent; copper alloyed with 2 to 18&#xA0;percent tin has been found in ancient specimens of bronze."}
