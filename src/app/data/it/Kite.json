An increasing number winter in Israel. They build their nests in the forks of tall trees and store food in the nest before laying eggs. The red kite, a rare winter visitor, is a reddish-brown bird, barred with black, with a grayish-white head.<strong>[Picture on page&#xA0;178]</strong>Black kite; a bird not suitable for food, according to the Mosaic Law"}
