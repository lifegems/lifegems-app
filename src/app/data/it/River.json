In contrast, a wadi, or torrent valley (Heb., <em>na&#x2B9;chal</em>), is often dry but at times carries a turbulent flow of water. Among the main rivers mentioned in the Bible are the Hiddekel (Tigris), Euphrates, Jordan, Abanah, and Pharpar.

This river broke up into four headwaters, which, in turn, resulted in rivers, the Pishon, the Gihon, the Hiddekel, and the Euphrates. The regions (Havilah, Cush, and Assyria) referred to in connection with these four rivers existed in the post-Flood period. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003745/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:10-14</a>) So it appears that the writer of the account, Moses, used terms familiar in his day to indicate the location of Eden&#x2019;s garden. For this reason it cannot be established with certainty whether what is said about the courses of the Pishon, Gihon, and Hiddekel applies to the post-Flood period or to the pre-Flood period. If the description relates to the time before the Flood, the Flood itself may well have contributed to changing the courses of these rivers. If to the post-Flood period, other natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, may since have altered their courses, hindering the identification of some.<strong>Figurative Use. </strong>Rivers served as a barrier to the progress of enemy forces and played a vital role in the defense of certain cities, such as Babylon.
