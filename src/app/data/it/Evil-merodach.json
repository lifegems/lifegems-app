In the year of his becoming king, Evil-merodach extended kindness to Jehoiachin the king of Judah by releasing him from the house of detention. That was in the 37th year of Jehoiachin&#x2019;s exile in Babylon. Evil-merodach granted him a position of favor above all the other kings who were in captivity in Babylon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001453/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 25:27-30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001453/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 52:31-34</a>) Josephus claims that Evil-merodach viewed Jehoiachin as one of his most intimate friends.There is also archaeological testimony concerning Evil-merodach (Awil-Marduk, Amil-Marduk). For example, an inscription on a vase found near Susa reads: &#x201C;Palace of Amil-Marduk, King of Babylon, son of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon.&#x201D; (<em>M&#xE9;moires de la mission arch&#xE9;ologique de Susiane, </em>by&#xA0;V. Scheil, Paris, 1913, Vol.&#xA0;XIV) Berossus, quoted by Josephus, attributes to him a reign of two years. Josephus himself assigns him 18 years. Supposedly slain as the result of a plot, Evil-merodach was replaced by Neriglissar (Nergal-sharezer). Reliable confirmation of these details is lacking."}
