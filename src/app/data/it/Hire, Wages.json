The latter is thus viewed as a gift rather than a wage earned by labor and is generally used in a bad sense. The Law forbade bringing into the sanctuary for a vow either &#x201C;the hire of a harlot&#x201D; or &#x201C;the price of a dog,&#x201D; this latter likely referring to the hire of a male homosexual.
