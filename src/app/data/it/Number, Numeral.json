Sometime after the exile to Babylon, the Jews adopted to some extent the practice of using their alphabetic letters as symbols of numerical figures. However, this usage does not appear even in postexilic Hebrew Bible manuscripts. One of the oldest extant specimens of Hebrew writing is the inscription taken from <span id=\"page511\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"511\" data-before-text=\"511\"></span>the Siloam water tunnel (probably from the time of Hezekiah&#x2019;s reign [745-717&#xA0;B.C.E.]), in which the measurements are written out in full. Spelling out the numbers provides an added measure of accuracy and dependability in the manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures, which have been copied many times, for, in copying, a numeral is usually easier to mistake than a word.In Hebrew, numbers above ten are a combination of words, such as 12 (two and ten) (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:4</a>), except that 20 is the plural of ten; 30 a plural word derived from three; 40 a plural word derived from four, and so on. One hundred is a separate word; 200 is the dual form. Other &#x201C;hundreds&#x201D; are composed of two words, as, 300. The highest number expressed by one Hebrew word is 20,000, the dual form of 10,000 (myriad). Larger numbers are a combination of words. For example, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 5:18</a> the number 44,760 is, literally, forty and four thousand and seven of hundreds and sixty. A million is written as a thousand thousands. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 14:9</a>) Rebekah&#x2019;s family blessed her, saying: &#x201C;O&#xA0;you, our sister, may you become thousands times ten thousand [literally, thousands of myriads].&#x201D; (Rebekah&#x2019;s posterity actually came to number many millions.) (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 24:55,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;60</a>) In Daniel&#x2019;s vision Jehovah is shown as having &#x201C;ten thousand times ten thousand [literally, a myriad of myriads]&#x201D; standing before him.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Da 7:10</a>.Occasionally numbers are used in an approximate sense, as round numbers, for example, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 90:10</a>, where the psalmist speaks of man&#x2019;s age limit, and possibly also at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Kings 19:18</a> (7,000 who had not bowed to Baal) and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Chronicles 14:9</a> (the million Ethiopians defeated by Asa).In the Christian Greek Scriptures numerals are generally expressed in words. The number of &#x201C;the wild beast&#x201D; is in words in the Sinaitic and the Alexandrine manuscripts.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Re 13:18</a>.<strong>Bible Usage Not Numerology. </strong>Since the Bible is a book of both history and prophecy, the numbers given therein may be either literal or symbolic. The context usually reveals in which sense a number is used. Certain numbers appear often in the Bible in an illustrative, figurative, or symbolic sense, and in such cases an understanding of their significance is vital to an understanding of the text. However, this Bible usage of numbers should not be confused with numerology, in which occult mysticism is attached to figures, their combinations, and numerical totals. Numerology apparently had its origin in ancient Babylon and, along with other forms of divination, comes under divine condemnation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">De 18:10-12</a>.In the following we will discuss a few of the figurative uses of certain numbers that are used prominently in the Bible.<strong>One. </strong>This number, when used figuratively, conveys the thought of singleness, uniqueness, as well as unity and agreement in purpose and action. &#x201C;Jehovah our God is one Jehovah,&#x201D; said Moses. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">De 6:4</a>) He alone is Sovereign. He is unique. He does not share his glory with another, as is the case with pagan trinitarian gods.

Agreement in the accounts of two witnesses adds to the force of the testimony. Two witnesses, or even three, were required to establish a matter before the judges. This principle is also followed in the Christian congregation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">De 17:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/15/2\" data-bid=\"16-3\" class=\"b\"> Mt 18:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/15/3\" data-bid=\"16-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Co 13:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/15/4\" data-bid=\"16-5\" class=\"b\"> 1Ti 5:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/15/5\" data-bid=\"16-6\" class=\"b\"> Heb 10:28</a>) God adhered to this principle in presenting his Son to the people as mankind&#x2019;s Savior.

The number three, therefore, is used at times to represent intensity, emphasis, or added strength. &#x201C;A threefold cord cannot quickly be torn in two.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003278/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 4:12</a>) Emphasis was achieved in Jesus&#x2019; threefold questioning of Peter after Peter&#x2019;s three denials of Jesus.

At times it has reference to bringing a work toward completion. Or it can refer to the complete cycle of things as established or allowed by God.
