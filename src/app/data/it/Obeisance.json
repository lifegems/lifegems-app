The <em>manner </em>of expressing the obeisance is perhaps not so prominent in <em>pro&#xB7;sky&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;o </em>as in <em>hish&#xB7;ta&#xB7;chawah&#x2B9;, </em>where the Hebrew term graphically conveys the thought of prostration or bowing down. Scholars derive the Greek term from the verb <em>ky&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;o, </em>&#x201C;kiss.&#x201D; The usage of the word in the Christian Greek Scriptures (as also in the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>translation of the Hebrew Scriptures) shows that persons to whose actions the term is applied prostrated themselves or bowed down.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 2:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> 28:9</a>.As with the Hebrew term, the context must be considered to determine whether <em>pro&#xB7;sky&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;o </em>refers to obeisance solely in the form of deep respect or obeisance in the form of religious worship.

The very expressions of those involved often reveal that, while they clearly recognized Jesus as God&#x2019;s representative, they rendered obeisance to him, not as to God or a deity, but as &#x201C;God&#x2019;s Son,&#x201D; the foretold &#x201C;Son of man,&#x201D; the Messiah with divine authority.

Peter therefore rightly refused to let Cornelius make too much of him.So, too, John, by virtue of having been declared righteous or justified by God as an anointed Christian, called to be a heavenly son of God and a member of the Kingdom, was in a different relationship to the angel(s) of Revelation than were the Israelites to the angels that had earlier appeared to them.

No matter what English term is used, the original Greek remains the same and the understanding of what it is that the angels render to Christ must accord with the rest of the Scriptures. Jesus himself emphatically stated to Satan that &#x201C;it is Jehovah your God you must worship [form of <em>pro&#xB7;sky&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;o</em>], and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:8-10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 4:7,&#xA0;8</a>) Similarly, the angel(s) told John to &#x201C;worship God&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Re 19:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> 22:9</a>), and this injunction came after Jesus&#x2019; resurrection and exaltation, showing that matters had not changed in this regard. True, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 97</a>, which the apostle evidently quotes at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 1:6</a>, refers to Jehovah God as the object of the &#x2018;bowing down,&#x2019; and still this text was applied to Christ Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 97:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/41/1\" data-bid=\"42-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;7</a>) However, the apostle previously had shown that the resurrected Christ is &#x201C;the reflection of [God&#x2019;s] glory and the exact representation of his very being.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 1:1-3</a>) Hence, if what we understand as &#x201C;worship&#x201D; is apparently directed to the Son by angels, it is in reality being directed through him to Jehovah God, the Sovereign Ruler, &#x201C;the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Re 14:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/43/1\" data-bid=\"44-2\" class=\"b\"> 4:10, 11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/43/2\" data-bid=\"44-3\" class=\"b\"> 7:11, 12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/43/3\" data-bid=\"44-4\" class=\"b\"> 11:16, 17</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 29:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/44/1\" data-bid=\"45-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 5:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/44/2\" data-bid=\"45-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:22</a>.) On the other hand, the renderings &#x201C;bow before&#x201D; and &#x2018;pay homage&#x2019; (instead of &#x201C;worship&#x201D;) are in no way out of harmony with the original language, either the Hebrew of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 97:7</a> or the Greek of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 1:6</a>, for such translations convey the basic sense of both <em>hish&#xB7;ta&#xB7;chawah&#x2B9; </em>and <em>pro&#xB7;sky&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;o.</em>"}
