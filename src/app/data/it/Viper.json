The venom of vipers varies according to types, several of which exist in Palestine. One of the most dangerous is the sand viper (<em>Vipera ammodytes</em>) of the Jordan Valley. Another kind is the Palestine viper (<em>Vipera palaestina</em>). The Hebrew <em>&#x2BC;eph&#xB7;&#x2BD;eh&#x2B9; </em>is commonly connected with the Arabic <em>&#x2BC;af&#x2BD;an, </em>which refers to the carpet viper, a poisonous snake of the sandy Jericho plains.The potency of the viper&#x2019;s poison is alluded to at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004561/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 20:16</a>, where Zophar speaks of &#x201C;the tongue of a viper&#x201D; as having the power to kill. Shipwrecked on the island of Malta, the apostle Paul was collecting a bundle of sticks and laying them upon a fire when a viper came out and fastened itself on Paul&#x2019;s hand. However, Paul &#x201C;shook the venomous creature off into the fire and suffered no harm,&#x201D; though the people standing by expected Paul to swell up with inflammation or suddenly die.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004561/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 28:3-6</a>.<strong>Illustrative Use. </strong>The dangerous bite of the viper is used in an illustrative way at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004561/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 23:32</a>, where the wise man describes the effects of the excessive use of wine, saying: &#x201C;It bites just like a serpent, and it secretes poison just like a viper [Heb., <em>u&#xB7;khetsiph&#xB7;&#x2BD;o&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;</em>].&#x201D; Describing the wickedness that God&#x2019;s people Israel had come to practice, the prophet Isaiah wrote: &#x201C;The eggs of a poisonous snake are what they have hatched .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Anyone eating some of their eggs would die, and the egg that was smashed would be hatched into a viper.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004561/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 59:5</a>) Most snakes lay eggs, and while the majority of the vipers are not oviparous (egg laying), certain types are.John the Baptizer called the Pharisees and Sadducees &#x201C;offspring of vipers.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004561/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 3:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004561/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 3:7</a>) And Jesus Christ called the scribes and Pharisees &#x201C;offspring of vipers&#x201D; because of their wickedness and the deadly spiritual harm they could inflict upon unsuspecting persons.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004561/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004561/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 23:33</a>."}
