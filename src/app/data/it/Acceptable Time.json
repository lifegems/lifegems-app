(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 49:3</a>) It was clearly a restoration prophecy and, hence, had its first fulfillment at the time of the liberation of Israel from Babylon when the call went to the Israelite prisoners, &#x201C;Come out!&#x201D; They thereafter returned to their homeland and rehabilitated the desolated land.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 49:9</a>.However, the words &#x201C;that I might give you as a covenant for the people&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">verse 8</a> of this chapter and the preceding statement in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">verse 6</a> that this &#x201C;servant&#x201D; of Jehovah would be given as &#x201C;a light of the nations, that [God&#x2019;s] salvation may come to be to the extremity of the earth,&#x201D; definitely mark the prophecy as Messianic and as therefore applying to Christ Jesus as God&#x2019;s &#x201C;servant.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 42:1-4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 6, 7</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:18-21</a>.) Since the &#x201C;time of goodwill&#x201D; was a time when Jehovah would &#x2018;answer&#x2019; and &#x2018;help&#x2019; his servant, it must apply to Jesus&#x2019; earthly life when he &#x201C;offered up supplications and also petitions to the One who was able to save him out of death, with strong outcries and tears, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 5:7-9</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 12:27, 28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 17:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 22:41-44;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/9/3\" data-bid=\"10-4\" class=\"b\"> 23:46</a>.) It was, therefore, &#x201C;a day of salvation&#x201D; for God&#x2019;s own Son, during which period of opportunity he demonstrated perfection of integrity and, as a result, &#x201C;became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 5:9</a>.Additionally, Paul&#x2019;s quotation from this prophecy indicates a still further application to those Christians whom Paul urges &#x201C;not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose,&#x201D; and to whom he says (after quoting <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000068/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 49:8</a>): &#x201C;Look!
