South of the portion for Judah, which was the seventh allotment from the northern extremity, was an administrative strip of land. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002057/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 48:1-8</a>) The northern border of this strip ran along the southern border of Judah&#x2019;s allotment; it was bounded on the S by Benjamin&#x2019;s portion, which was the fifth allotment from the southern extremity.
