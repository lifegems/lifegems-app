The oppressors came from various directions; the areas where the Judges were active were not always the same. But, regardless of how powerful the enemy was, when Israel humbly repented of their bad practices and truly trusted in Jehovah, the Judge would deliver them. This Bible book gives a foregleam of the greater deliverance that God will provide for his servants by means of his Son.<strong>[Chart/<wbr></strong><strong>Map on page&#xA0;743]</strong>(For fully formatted text, see publication)<em>Great Sea</em>OTHNIEL Dan Beth-anath Kedesh HazorELON<em>Sea of Galilee</em><em>Jordan River</em> HaroshethBARAK<em>T.V. of Kishon</em>Mt.&#xA0;TaborHarod Kedesh Beth-shittahJAIR  GILEADGIDEON Abel-meholahTOLA ShamirJEPHTHAH Succoth Penuel Mizpah JogbehahABDON PirathonEHUD Gilgal Abel-keramim Minnith  AMMON  MOAB Timnah Zorah Lehi Bethlehem<em>T.V. of Sorek</em>SHAMGAR AshkelonIBZAN HebronSAMSON Gaza Beer-sheba<em>Salt Sea</em><strong>[Chart]</strong><strong>Judges and Their Exploits</strong> Abdon      <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 12:13-15</a> Barak      <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:1&#x2013;5:31</a> Ehud       <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 3:12-30</a> Elon       <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 12:11, 12</a> Gideon     <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 6:1&#x2013;8:35</a> Ibzan      <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 12:8-10</a> Jair       <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 10:3-5</a> Jephthah   <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 10:6&#x2013;12:7</a> Othniel    <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 3:7-11</a> Samson     <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 13:1&#x2013;16:31</a> Shamgar    <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 3:31</a> Tola       <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001393/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 10:1, 2</a>"}
