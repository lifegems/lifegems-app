(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Tit 1:12</a>.) Though this includes the thought of a predictor of the future, the <em>fundamental </em>meaning of the word is not that of prediction. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 6:7-10</a>.) Nonetheless, living in harmony with God&#x2019;s will requires that the individual know what Jehovah&#x2019;s revealed purposes for the future are so that he may bring his ways, desires, and goals into line with the divine will. Hence, in the great majority of cases, the Biblical prophets did convey messages that were, directly or indirectly, related to the future.<strong>Prophetic Office in the Hebrew Scriptures. </strong>The first human spokesman for God obviously was Adam, who initially conveyed God&#x2019;s instructions to his wife Eve and to that extent fulfilled the role of prophet. Those instructions had to do not only with the present (for them) but also with the future, outlining God&#x2019;s purpose for earth and mankind and the course humans must take to enjoy a blessed future.

Yet God had given him a message, a prophetic promise. Abraham must have felt agitated, <span id=\"page695\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"695\" data-before-text=\"695\"></span>impelled to &#x2018;speak forth&#x2019; about this, particularly to his family, explaining why he was leaving Ur and what God&#x2019;s promise to him was.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 105:9-15</a>) Additionally, they gave predictive blessings to their sons.

The prophet&#x2019;s position as spokesman for God is emphasized by Jehovah&#x2019;s assignment of Aaron as a &#x201C;prophet&#x201D; or &#x201C;mouth&#x201D; to Moses, while Moses &#x2018;served as God to Aaron.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 4:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 7:1,&#xA0;2</a>) Moses foretold many events that saw early fulfillment, such as the Ten Plagues. However, he served even more impressively as prophet, or spokesman for God, in the delivering of the Law covenant at Sinai and in instructing the nation in God&#x2019;s will. Though the Law covenant was of immense immediate value to the Israelites as a moral code and guide, it, too, pointed forward to the future and &#x2018;better things to come.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 3:23-25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 8:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/13/2\" data-bid=\"14-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:23, 24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/13/3\" data-bid=\"14-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:1</a>) Moses&#x2019; intimate, often two-way, communication with God, and the greatly increased understanding of Jehovah&#x2019;s will and purpose he was used to convey, made his prophetic position outstanding.

By Samuel&#x2019;s time, &#x201C;word from Jehovah had become rare&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;; there was no vision being spread abroad.&#x201D; From boyhood Samuel served as God&#x2019;s spokesman, and the fulfillment of the divine messages caused all to recognize him as &#x201C;one accredited for the position of prophet to Jehovah.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 3:1-14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> 18-21</a>.With the establishment of the monarchy, an almost continuous line of prophets appears. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 3:24</a>.) Gad began prophesying prior to Samuel&#x2019;s death.

Some were used to prophesy to the leaders and people of both kingdoms. Among exilic and postexilic prophets were Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.The prophets played a vital role in maintaining true worship. Their activity served as a check on the kings of Israel and Judah, for they boldly reproved erring rulers (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 12:1-12</a>) and declared God&#x2019;s judgments against those who practiced wickedness.

Like Moses, the prophets on many occasions acted as intercessors, praying to God in behalf of king and people. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">De 9:18-29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/26/1\" data-bid=\"27-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 13:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/26/2\" data-bid=\"27-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 19:1-4</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 7:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> 14:11,&#xA0;12</a>.) They were especially active in times of crisis or great need. They gave hope for the future, as at times their messages foretold the blessings of Messiah&#x2019;s government. In this way they benefited not only those then living but future generations down to our day.

Their total concentration and zealous boldness in their mission might cause their behavior to appear strange, even irrational, to others, just as a prophet so appeared to military chiefs when Jehu was anointed. Yet, on realizing that the man was a prophet, the chiefs accepted his message with full seriousness.

When Saul, in pursuit of David, was caused to &#x2018;behave like a prophet,&#x2019; he stripped off his garments and lay &#x201C;naked all that day and all that night,&#x201D; during which time David evidently escaped.

Not all, however, are recorded as performing such powerful works. The three essentials for establishing the credentials of a true prophet, as given through Moses, were: The true prophet would speak in Jehovah&#x2019;s name; the things foretold would come to pass (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">De 18:20-22</a>); and his prophesying must promote true worship, being in harmony with God&#x2019;s revealed word and commandments (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">De 13:1-4</a>). The last requirement was probably the most vital and decisive, for an individual might hypocritically use God&#x2019;s name, and by coincidence, his prediction might see fulfillment. But the true prophet was not solely or even primarily a prognosticator, as has been shown. Rather, he was an advocate of righteousness, and his message dealt primarily with moral standards and their application. He expressed God&#x2019;s mind on matters. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 1:10-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/57/1\" data-bid=\"58-2\" class=\"b\"> Mic 6:1-12</a>) Hence, it was not necessary to wait perhaps for years or generations to determine whether the prophet was true or false by fulfillment of a prediction. If his message contradicted God&#x2019;s revealed will and standards, he was false. Thus, a prophet who foretold peace for Israel or Judah, at a time when the people were engaging in disobedience to God&#x2019;s Word and Law, of necessity was false.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 6:13, 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/58/1\" data-bid=\"59-2\" class=\"b\"> 14:11-16</a>.Jesus&#x2019; later warning concerning false prophets paralleled that of Moses. Though using his name, and giving &#x201C;signs and wonders to lead astray,&#x201D; their fruits would prove them &#x201C;workers of lawlessness.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:15-23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/59/1\" data-bid=\"60-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 13:21-23</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 2:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/60/1\" data-bid=\"61-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Jo 4:1-3</a>.The true prophet never foretold simply to satisfy human curiosity.

The false prophets lulled the people and their leaders with soothing assurances that, despite their unrighteous course, God was still with them to protect and prosper them. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 23:16-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/62/1\" data-bid=\"63-2\" class=\"b\"> 28:1-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/62/2\" data-bid=\"63-3\" class=\"b\"> Eze 13:1-16</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/63/0\" data-bid=\"64-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 6:26</a>.)

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/89/0\" data-bid=\"90-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:11-40</a>) Again it should be remembered that prophesying does not mean solely or necessarily predicting the future. The apostle Paul stated that &#x201C;he that prophesies upbuilds and encourages and consoles men by his speech,&#x201D; and he held prophesying forth as a proper and particularly desirable goal for all Christians to strive after. Whereas speaking foreign tongues was a sign for unbelievers, prophesying was for believers. Yet even the unbeliever attending a Christian meeting would benefit by prophesying, being reproved and closely examined by it so that &#x201C;the secrets of his heart become manifest.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/90/0\" data-bid=\"91-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 14:1-6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/90/1\" data-bid=\"91-2\" class=\"b\"> 22-25</a>) This, too, indicates that Christian prophesying did not consist mainly of prediction but instead often dealt with things relating to the present, though clearly proceeding from a source beyond the ordinary, being inspired by God. Paul counseled on the need for good order and self-control in congregational prophesying, so that all could learn and be encouraged.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/91/0\" data-bid=\"92-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 14:29-33</a>.There were, of course, certain ones particularly selected, or gifted, to serve as prophets. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/92/0\" data-bid=\"93-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 12:4-11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/92/1\" data-bid=\"93-2\" class=\"b\"> 27-29</a>) Paul himself had the gift of prophesying, yet he is primarily known as an apostle. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/93/0\" data-bid=\"94-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 20:22-25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/93/1\" data-bid=\"94-2\" class=\"b\"> 27:21-26,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/93/2\" data-bid=\"94-3\" class=\"b\"> 31,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/93/3\" data-bid=\"94-4\" class=\"b\"> 34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/93/4\" data-bid=\"94-5\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 13:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/93/5\" data-bid=\"94-6\" class=\"b\"> 14:6</a>.) Those especially designated as prophets, such as Agabus, Judas, and Silas, appear to have been outstanding spokesmen for the Christian congregation, second only to the apostles.
