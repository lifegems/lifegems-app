Evidence suggests that they extended their roaming to western Siberia near the border of Mongolia. In the first century C.E. the word &#x201C;Scythian&#x201D; implied the worst of uncivilized people. However, even such persons could become Christians and have an equal standing with other believers as members of Christ&#x2019;s body.
