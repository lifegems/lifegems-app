As the apostle Peter states, the ancient prophets themselves kept &#x201C;investigating what particular season or what sort of season the spirit in them was indicating concerning Christ [Messiah] when it was bearing witness beforehand about the sufferings for Christ and about the glories to follow these.&#x201D; It was revealed to them that these things were to have a future fulfillment beyond their own time.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:10-12</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Da 9:24-27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\"> 12:1-10</a>.Since Christ Jesus is the One in whom all these prophecies see realization, marking them all as true, it can be seen how &#x201C;the truth came to be through Jesus Christ.&#x201D; &#x201C;For no matter how many the promises of God are, they have become Yes by means of him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/34/1\" data-bid=\"35-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Co 1:20</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 18:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/35/1\" data-bid=\"36-2\" class=\"b\"> 24:25, 26,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/35/2\" data-bid=\"36-3\" class=\"b\"> 44-46</a>.)

For the original receivers, the prophecies assured them that the passing of years or centuries had not caused God to waver in his purpose, that he was holding firm to his covenant terms and promises. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 77:5-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 44:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/37/2\" data-bid=\"38-3\" class=\"b\"> 49:14-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/37/3\" data-bid=\"38-4\" class=\"b\"> Jer 50:5</a>.) Daniel&#x2019;s prophecy, for example, provided information that constituted an invaluable link between the close of the writing of the Hebrew or pre-Christian Scriptures and Messiah&#x2019;s coming. Its forecast of world events, including the rise and fall of successive world powers, gave assurance to Jews living during the centuries of Persian, Greek, and Roman dominance (as well as to Christians thereafter) that there was no &#x201C;blind spot&#x201D; in God&#x2019;s forevision, that their own times were indeed foreseen and that Jehovah&#x2019;s sovereign purpose was still certain of fulfillment. It protected them against putting faith and hope in such passing world regimes with their transient power of control and enabled those faithful ones to direct their course with wisdom.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Da 8:20-26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> 11:1-20</a>.The fact that many prophecies were fulfilled in their own times convinced sincere ones of God&#x2019;s power to carry out his purpose despite all opposition. It was proof of his unique Godship that he, and he alone, could foretell such events and bring them to pass.

Yet these prophecies did not lose their value for later generations, as for the Christian congregation, either in the first century C.E. or in our own time. The apostle says: &#x201C;For all the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 15:4</a>) Since God is unchangeable in his moral standards and purpose (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Mal 3:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/42/1\" data-bid=\"43-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 6:17,&#xA0;18</a>), his dealings with Israel shed light on how he will deal with similar situations at any given time.

Hence, in discussing the matter of double fulfillment of prophecy, M&#x2019;Clintock and Strong&#x2019;s <em>Cyclop&#xE6;dia </em>(1894, Vol.&#xA0;VIII, p.&#xA0;635) comments: &#x201C;This view of the fulfilment of prophecy seems necessary for the explanation of our Lord&#x2019;s prediction on the Mount, relating at once to the fall of Jerusalem and to the end of the Christian dispensation.&#x201D;<strong>Forms of Prophecy. </strong>In addition to direct statements issued through his prophets (perhaps accompanied by symbolic acts [<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/64/0\" data-bid=\"65-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 11:29-31</a>] or in allegorical form), Jehovah used other forms. <em>Prophetic characters </em>prefigured the Messiah, Christ Jesus. Besides David, already mentioned, these included the priest-king Melchizedek (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/65/0\" data-bid=\"66-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:15-17</a>), the prophet Moses (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/66/0\" data-bid=\"67-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 3:20-22</a>), and others. It should be noted that, with regard to prophetic characters, the individual is not to be viewed as typical or prophetic in every aspect. Thus Jonah&#x2019;s three days in the belly of the great fish prefigured Jesus&#x2019; time in Sheol; but Jonah&#x2019;s reluctance to accept his assignment and other aspects did not prefigure the course of God&#x2019;s Son. Jesus spoke of himself as &#x201C;something more than Solomon,&#x201D; for Jesus&#x2019; wisdom and the peace of his Kingdom rule are like that of Solomon but superior to it. However, Jesus does not become spiritually delinquent as Solomon did.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003561/67/0\" data-bid=\"68-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:39-42</a>.<em>Prophetic dramas </em>were also used by God, details from the lives of individuals and nations being recorded as a pattern of future events in the outworking of Jehovah&#x2019;s purpose. Paul speaks of such &#x201C;a symbolic drama&#x201D; involving Abraham&#x2019;s two sons by Sarah and the slave girl Hagar. He shows that the two women &#x201C;mean&#x201D; two covenant relationships. They did not personally typify, or picture, such covenants. But in the prophetic drama those women corresponded to symbolic women who produced children under those covenants. Thus Hagar corresponded to earthly Jerusalem, which failed to accept the Deliverer to whom the Law covenant pointed and clung to that Law even after God had terminated it; earthly Jerusalem <span id=\"page694\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"694\" data-before-text=\"694\"></span>and its children were thus in slavery to the Law. On the other hand, Sarah, the free woman, corresponded to &#x201C;the Jerusalem above,&#x201D; God&#x2019;s heavenly wifelike organization, which produces sons in accord with what was foretold in the Abrahamic covenant.
