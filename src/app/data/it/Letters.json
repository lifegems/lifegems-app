Thousands of clay tablets have been found in Babylonia and other regions. Washed and cleaned, smooth clay was made into a tablet and, while still wet, it was imprinted by means of a stylus forming wedge-shaped (cuneiform) characters. These tablets were often enclosed in clay envelopes. In the case of contracts, the text was sometimes repeated on the envelope. The envelopes were sealed and then baked in a kiln or dried in the sun to make them hard and durable.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002723/0\">ARCHAEOLOGY</a>.Letter writing was often done by professional scribes. As in the Persian court, such scribes were usually on hand to take down official government correspondence.

Postal service itself seems to have been restricted to official correspondence down to Roman times. So average persons had to rely on traveling acquaintances or merchants to deliver their letters.Anciently, letters of recommendation were also used. However, the apostle Paul did not need such letters to or from the Christians at Corinth to prove that he was a minister. He had helped them to become Christians and therefore could say: &#x201C;You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our hearts and known and being read by all mankind.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002723/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 3:1-3</a>.In the first century C.E., letters from Paul, James, Peter, John, Jude, and the governing body in Jerusalem contributed to the growth and the preservation of the unity and cleanness of the Christian congregation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002723/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 15:22-31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002723/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:4,&#xA0;5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002723/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Co 7:8,&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002723/10/3\" data-bid=\"11-4\" class=\"b\"> 10:8-11</a>."}
