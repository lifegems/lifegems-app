The Hebrew word <em>berith&#x2B9;, </em>whose etymology is uncertain, appears over 280 times in the Hebrew Scriptures; more than 80 of these occurrences are in the five books of Moses. That its basic meaning is &#x201C;covenant,&#x201D; comparable to our modern legal word &#x201C;contract,&#x201D; is seen from cuneiform tablets found in 1927 at Qatna, an ancient non-Israelite city SE of Hamath. &#x201C;The contents of the two tablets [of 15 found] are simple. Tablet A contains a list of names .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Tablet B is a ration list .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. List A is thus a <em>compact </em>in which the men in question .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. agree to enter someone&#x2019;s service or to carry out certain obligations. List B, written by the same scribe, then illustrates the nature of the <em>compact; </em>the men were to receive specified rations in return for their services. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. the Israelite concept of <em>b<sup>e</sup>rit, </em>&#x2018;covenant,&#x2019; was a central theme in Yahwist theology. Here we have the first published extra-biblical occurrence of the word from early times<wbr>&#x2014;not later than the first third of the fourteenth century B.C.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, </em>February&#xA0;1951, p.&#xA0;22.In some translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures the word <em>di&#xB7;a&#xB7;the&#x2B9;ke </em>is variously rendered &#x201C;covenant,&#x201D; &#x201C;will,&#x201D; &#x201C;testament&#x201D; (<em>testamentum, </em>Vg). However, M&#x2019;Clintock and Strong&#x2019;s <em>Cyclop&#xE6;dia </em>(1891) says, under &#x201C;Covenant&#x201D;: &#x201C;There seems, however, to be no necessity for the introduction of a new word [other than &#x201C;covenant&#x201D;] conveying a new idea. The Sept[uagint] having rendered [<em>berith&#x2B9;</em>] (which never means <em>will </em>or <em>testament, </em>but always <em>covenant </em>or <em>agreement</em>) by [<em>di&#xB7;a&#xB7;the&#x2B9;ke</em>] consistently throughout the O.T., the N.T. writers, in adopting that word, may naturally be supposed to intend to convey to their readers, most of them familiar with the Greek O.T., the same idea. Moreover, in the majority of cases, the same thing which has been called a &#x2018;covenant&#x2019; (<em>b<sup>e</sup>rith&#x2B9;</em>) in the O.T. is referred to in the N.T. (e.g. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Cor. iii, 14;</a> <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Heb. vii, ix;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Rev. xi,&#xA0;19</a>); while in the same context the same word and thing in the Greek are in the English [in <em>KJ</em>] sometimes represented by &#x2018;covenant,&#x2019; and sometimes by &#x2018;testament&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Heb. vii, 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> viii, 8-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> ix,&#xA0;15</a>).&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;See also <em>NW </em>appendix, pp.&#xA0;1584, 1585.Repeatedly in the book of Hebrews (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 8:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> 8, 9, 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> 9:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/3/4\" data-bid=\"4-5\" class=\"b\"> 15, 16, 17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/3/5\" data-bid=\"4-6\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;20</a>) the writer uses the word <em>di&#xB7;a&#xB7;the&#x2B9;ke </em>with undeniable reference to a <span id=\"page521\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"521\" data-before-text=\"521\"></span><em>covenant </em>in the old Hebrew sense, even quoting from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a> and referring to &#x201C;the ark of the covenant.&#x201D; In translating these verses of Jeremiah, the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>uses <em>di&#xB7;a&#xB7;the&#x2B9;ke </em>for the ancient Hebrew <em>berith&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;covenant.&#x201D; Also, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 9:20</a> quotes from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Exodus 24:6-8</a>, where a covenant is unmistakably spoken of.<strong>Application of the Word. </strong>Covenants always involved two or more parties. They could be <em>unilateral </em>(where the party on one side was solely responsible to carry out the terms) or <em>bilateral </em>(where parties on both sides had terms to carry out). Besides the covenants in which God is a party, the Bible records the making of covenants between men, and between tribes, nations, or groups of persons.

Often these were sealed within clay envelopes.<strong>The Edenic Promise. </strong>Jehovah God, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 3:15</a>, stated his purpose prophetically in the garden of Eden in the presence of Adam, Eve, and the &#x201C;serpent.&#x201D;As to the identity of those involved in this promise and prophecy: The vision given to the apostle John, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 12:9</a>, informs us that the &#x201C;serpent&#x201D; is Satan the Devil. Evidence indicates that the &#x201C;seed&#x201D; of the &#x201C;woman,&#x201D; long looked for by righteous men, is to be identified with the &#x201C;seed&#x201D; of Abraham, Jesus Christ. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 3:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 1:1</a>) The &#x201C;seed&#x201D; was to be bruised in the heel by the serpent. Jesus Christ was put to death, a wound that proved not to be permanent, however, for God raised Jesus out of death. But the &#x201C;seed&#x201D; is, in turn, to bruise the serpent&#x2019;s head, defeating him permanently.Who is the &#x201C;woman&#x201D; involved in the covenant? Certainly not Eve, who had become God&#x2019;s enemy. In order to defeat, &#x201C;bring to nothing,&#x201D; the <em>spirit </em>creature Satan the Devil, the &#x201C;seed&#x201D; would have to be, not human, but spirit. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 2:14</a>) Jesus at birth was a human Son of God, but at the time of Jesus&#x2019; baptism God acknowledged him as His Son, sending holy spirit down upon him. Jesus here became the <em>spirit-begotten </em>Son of God.

The apostle Paul says that Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Hagar, and Ishmael figured in a symbolic drama, in which Isaac represented those who had heavenly hopes, including Paul himself. Paul then states that their &#x201C;mother&#x201D; is &#x201C;the Jerusalem above.&#x201D; Jesus Christ calls these <span id=\"page522\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"522\" data-before-text=\"522\"></span>his &#x201C;brothers,&#x201D; indicating they have the same mother. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 2:11</a>) This provides a basis for identifying the &#x201C;woman&#x201D; of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 3:15</a> with &#x201C;the Jerusalem above.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 4:21-29</a>.The terms of the promise imply a lapse of time during which the &#x201C;serpent&#x201D; would bring forth a &#x201C;seed&#x201D; and enmity would develop between the two &#x2018;seeds.&#x2019; Some 6,000 years have passed since the statement of the promise. Just prior to Christ&#x2019;s Thousand Year Reign the &#x201C;serpent&#x201D; will be hurled into the abyss of inactivity, and following the end of the thousand years he will be annihilated forever.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Re 20:1-3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> 7-10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/40/2\" data-bid=\"41-3\" class=\"b\"> Ro 16:20</a>.<strong>Covenant With Noah. </strong>Jehovah God made a covenant with Noah, who represented his family, with regard to His purpose to preserve human and animal life while destroying the wicked world of that day.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 5:32</a>) At the time God revealed this purpose to Noah, his sons were grown and married. Noah, on his part, was to build the ark and take in his wife, his sons, and his sons&#x2019; wives, as well as animals and food; Jehovah was to preserve flesh on earth, both of man and animals. Noah&#x2019;s obediently keeping the terms of the covenant resulted in Jehovah&#x2019;s preservation of human and animal life. The covenant was completely fulfilled in 2369&#xA0;B.C.E., after the Flood, when men and animals were again able to live on the ground and to reproduce their kind.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 8:15-17</a>.<strong>Rainbow Covenant. </strong>The rainbow covenant was made between Jehovah God and all flesh (human and animal), as represented by Noah and his family, in 2369&#xA0;B.C.E., in the mountains of Ararat. Jehovah stated that he would never again destroy all flesh by means of a flood. The rainbow was then given as a sign of the covenant, which endures as long as mankind lives on earth, that is, forever.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 9:8-17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/44/1\" data-bid=\"45-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 37:29</a>.<strong>Covenant With Abraham. </strong>The covenant with Abraham apparently went into effect when Abram (Abraham) crossed the Euphrates on his way to Canaan. The Law covenant was made 430 years later. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001054/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 3:17</a>) Jehovah had spoken to Abraham when he was living in Mesopotamia, in Ur of the Chaldeans, telling him to travel to the country that God would show him.

The day they were delivered from Egypt was Nisan 14, 1513&#xA0;B.C.E., the date of the Passover.
