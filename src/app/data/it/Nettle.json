When touched, the tips of the hairs break off, and the sharp broken ends penetrate the skin, causing the liquid to enter the wound. At least four varieties of nettles are known to exist in Palestine, the most common being the Roman nettle (<em>Urtica pilulifera</em>), which can attain a height of 1.8&#xA0;m (6&#xA0;ft) and is especially found amid ruins.The Hebrew terms <em>cha&#xB7;rul&#x2B9; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 24:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Zep 2:9</a>) and <em>qim&#xB7;mohs&#x2B9; </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 34:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Ho 9:6</a>) are applied to plants that take over neglected fields and ruins. At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Job 30:7</a>, the reference to <em>cha&#xB7;rul&#x2B9; </em>suggests tall plants. Another Hebrew word <em>sir&#xB7;padh&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;brier,&#x201D; <em>KJ; </em>&#x201C;nettle,&#x201D; <em>Ro; </em>&#x201C;stinging nettle,&#x201D; <em>NW</em>) is contrasted with myrtle.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 55:13</a>.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 24:31</a> a form of the word <em>qim&#xB7;mohs&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;thistles,&#x201D; <em>AT; </em>&#x201C;thorns,&#x201D; <em>KJ; </em>&#x201C;weeds,&#x201D; <em>NW</em>) is viewed by some as being in parallel with <em>cha&#xB7;rul&#x2B9;. </em>Therefore some scholars think <em>qim&#xB7;mohs&#x2B9; </em>denotes weeds generally; others believe that <em>cha&#xB7;rul&#x2B9; </em>may be a generic term applying to brush. The translating of <em>cha&#xB7;rul&#x2B9; </em>as &#x201C;nettles&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Job 30:7</a> has also been questioned by some on the basis that people would not voluntarily seek shelter under nettles. In a waterless region, though, people might well avail themselves of the shade of tall nettles or, because of hunger, be found gathering these plants for food. So the rendering is appropriate."}
