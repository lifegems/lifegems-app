A steep valley separates this site from the suggested location of ancient Michmash. In the valley there are two hills with steep rocky sides. These perhaps correspond to the &#x2018;toothlike crags&#x2019; Bozez and Seneh, one &#x201C;facing Michmash,&#x201D; the other &#x201C;facing Geba.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001627/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 14:4,&#xA0;5</a>.Geba was one of the cities that figured in King Saul&#x2019;s campaign against the Philistines. Evidently at the direction of his father Saul, Jonathan struck down the Philistine &#x201C;garrison&#x201D; at Geba. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001627/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 13:3,&#xA0;4</a>) In retaliation, the Philistines assembled a mighty force at Michmash, whereupon many Israelites fearfully went into hiding, some even fleeing across the Jordan. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001627/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 13:5-7</a>) Later, Jonathan made his way from Geba to the Philistine outpost, undoubtedly stationed at the edge of &#x201C;the ravine pass of Michmash.&#x201D; On his hands and feet, Jonathan ascended the steep passage to the outpost and, with the cooperation of his armor-bearer, struck down about 20 Philistines.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001627/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 14:6-14</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001627/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 13:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001627/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>.Years later, Asa fortified Geba with stones and timbers of Ramah.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001627/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 8:6</a>) On its way toward Jerusalem, the Assyrian army under Sennacherib apparently passed through Geba.
