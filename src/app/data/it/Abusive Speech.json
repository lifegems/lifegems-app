{"title":"Abusive Speech","link":"/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000064","html":"<span id=\"page35\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"35\" data-before-text=\"35\"></span><strong>ABUSIVE SPEECH</strong>The original Greek word <em>bla&#xB7;sphe&#xB7;mi&#x2B9;a </em>and the verb <em>bla&#xB7;sphe&#xB7;me&#x2B9;o </em>basically indicate defamatory, calumnious, abusive language. As noted under the heading <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000064/0\">BLASPHEMY</a>, the Greek word <em>bla&#xB7;sphe&#xB7;mi&#x2B9;a </em>has a broader meaning than the present English word &#x201C;blasphemy.&#x201D; In English, only when such speech is directed against God, not against his creatures, is it properly termed &#x201C;blasphemy.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000064/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:31</a>) Concerning this, <em>The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclop&#xE6;dia and Scriptural Dictionary </em>says: &#x201C;Our English translators [that is, primarily those of the <em>KJ</em>] have not adhered to the right use of the term. They employ it with the same latitude as the Greek; but it is generally easy to perceive, from the connection and subject of a passage, whether <em>blasphemy, </em>properly so called, be meant, or only defamation.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Edited by S.&#xA0;Fallows, 1912, Vol.&#xA0;I, p.&#xA0;291.Thus, while the <em>King James Version </em>uses &#x201C;blasphemy&#x201D; and &#x201C;blasphemed&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000064/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 18:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000064/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Colossians 3:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000064/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 1&#xA0;Timothy 6:1</a>, and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000064/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Titus 2:5</a>, later translations say &#x201C;slander,&#x201D; &#x201C;abusive talk [or &#x201C;speech&#x201D;],&#x201D; &#x201C;reviled,&#x201D; &#x201C;defamed,&#x201D; &#x201C;abused,&#x201D; &#x201C;spoken of abusively,&#x201D; and similar expressions. (See <em>RS, AT, NW, </em>and others.) However, the <em>King James Version </em>does recognize this distinction elsewhere in the Greek Scriptures.As the following texts and surrounding verses show, at the time of his impalement abusive speech was directed against Christ by passersby, who said, &#x201C;Bah! You would-be thrower-down of the temple and builder of it in three days&#x2019; time, save yourself by coming down off the torture stake.&#x201D; Similar words came from one of the evildoers alongside.

Evidently originally referring to inflicting violent physical injury, it is used figuratively to mean &#x201C;speak abusively,&#x201D; that is, harm with reproachful words.
