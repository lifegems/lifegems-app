Archaeologists separate daggers from swords by length, the point of differentiation being about 40&#xA0;cm (16&#xA0;in.).Generally the sword was suspended on the left side from the girdle (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:13</a>) and was worn in a sheath, a leather case or covering for the sword or the dagger. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Second Samuel 20:8</a> allows for the possibility that Joab deliberately adjusted his sword so that it fell from its sheath and then merely held the weapon in his hand instead of sheathing it once again. Unsuspecting Amasa perhaps thought it had fallen accidentally, and he was unconcerned. That proved fatal.In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the Greek word <em>ma&#x2B9;khai&#xB7;ra </em>is usually used for the sword (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:47</a>), though <em>rhom&#xB7;phai&#x2B9;a, </em>denoting a &#x201C;long sword,&#x201D; is also employed.

(See <em>The Jewish War, </em>by F.&#xA0;Josephus, III, 42 [iii,&#xA0;2].) Jesus&#x2019; words at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 22:36</a>, &#x201C;Let the one having no sword sell his outer garment and buy one,&#x201D; would not indicate that his disciples were about to enter into a hazardous life. Rather, he desired to have a sword available among his followers on that night in order to demonstrate clearly that, though they would come into circumstances that could easily provoke armed resistance, he did not intend to resort to the sword but would give himself up voluntarily in harmony with God&#x2019;s will. Thus, when Peter did react and try to put up armed resistance, lopping off the ear of Malchus, Jesus ordered him: &#x201C;Return your sword to its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:52;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 18:10,&#xA0;11</a>) Certainly, Peter&#x2019;s sword and the other one at hand would have availed little against such a large group of armed men, and by trying to use them, they would undoubtedly have &#x2018;perished by the sword.&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:47</a>) More important, such attempted delivery of Jesus would have failed, being completely contrary to Jehovah God&#x2019;s purpose.

Precise delineation between them, as designated by different Hebrew words, is somewhat uncertain.In the Hebrew Scriptures, the spear (Heb., <em>chanith&#x2B9;</em>) was apparently the largest of these four weapons, having a long wooden shaft and generally a sharp stone or metal head. In importance it ranked second to the sword. The giant Goliath carried a spear with a blade weighing &#x201C;six hundred shekels of iron&#x201D; (6.8&#xA0;kg; 15&#xA0;lb) and with a wooden shaft &#x201C;like the beam of loom workers.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:7</a>) Some spears had a metal point at the butt end by which they might be fixed in the ground. Hence, this end, and not just the spearhead, could be used effectively by a warrior. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 2:19-23</a>) A spear stuck in the earth might denote a king&#x2019;s temporary abode.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 26:7</a>.In the Christian Greek Scriptures the spear (Gr., <em>log&#x2B9;khe</em>) is mentioned in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">John 19:34</a>, which says that after Jesus Christ had died, &#x201C;one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear.&#x201D; Since this was a Roman soldier, the Roman pilum was probably used. Such a weapon was about 1.8&#xA0;m (6&#xA0;ft) long, with a barbed iron head extending halfway down the length of the wooden shaft.The lance (Heb., <em>ro&#x2B9;mach</em>), a weapon with a long shaft and a sharp point, was used for thrusting. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 25:7,&#xA0;8</a>) It was a standard weapon of the Hebrews.The javelin (Heb., <em>ki&#xB7;dhohn&#x2B9;</em>) had a pointed metal head and was usually thrown. It was apparently smaller and lighter than the conventional spear, <span id=\"page170\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"170\" data-before-text=\"170\"></span>which would allow for it to be held with outstretched arm. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 8:18-26</a>) The javelin was customarily carried not in the hand but on the back.The dart (Heb., <em>mas&#xB7;sa&#x2BD;&#x2B9;</em>) was evidently a short pointed missile similar to the arrow.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 6:16</a>) Among the Romans, darts were made of hollow reeds, and on the lower part, under the point, there was an iron receptacle that could be filled with burning naphtha. The dart was then shot from a slack bow, as projecting it from a taut bow would put out the fire. Endeavoring to extinguish such a missile with water would just increase the flame, and the only way to put it out was by covering the destructive projectile with earth.<em>Bow and arrow. </em>From early times the bow (Heb., <em>qe&#x2B9;sheth; </em>Gr., <em>to&#x2B9;xon</em>) was used in hunting and warfare.

Arrowheads were at first made of flint or bone and later of metal. Sometimes arrows were barbed, were dipped in poison (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Job 6:4</a>), or were dressed with combustible material.

Assyrian reliefs show that the quivers carried on chariots held 50 arrows.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 22:6</a>.<em>Sling. </em>From ancient times the sling (Heb., <em>qe&#x2B9;la&#x2BD;</em>) has been the weapon of shepherds (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:40</a>) and warriors. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 26:14</a>) It was a leather thong or was a band woven of such materials as animal sinews, rushes, or hair. &#x201C;The hollow of the sling,&#x201D; a widened center part, held the projectile. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:29</a>) One end of the sling might be tied to the hand or wrist while the other was held in the hand, to be freed when the sling was swung. The loaded sling was whirled overhead, perhaps several times, and then one end was suddenly released, sending the missile forward with considerable force and speed. Smooth, round stones were especially desired for slinging, though other projectiles were also used. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:40</a>) Slingers were a regular part of the armies of Judah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 26:14</a>) and Israel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 3:25</a>.<em>War club, handstave, and battle-ax. </em>The &#x201C;war club&#x201D; was evidently a heavy club or mace, sometimes studded with metal.

It was equipped with an inside handle and was carried by the warrior during battle, usually on the left arm or in the left hand, although during the march it may have been hung from a shoulder strap. <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 22:6</a> indicates that some may have been provided with a cover that was removed at time of combat. In peacetime, shields were often placed in arsenals.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 4:4</a>.Shields used in ancient times were often made of wood covered with leather, and such shields could be burned. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 39:9</a>) Whereas wooden and leather shields were in general use, it appears that metal shields were less common, being used especially by leaders, royal guards, or possibly for ceremonial purposes. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 8:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/54/1\" data-bid=\"55-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 14:27,&#xA0;28</a>) Shields were oiled to make them pliable and moisture resistant, to keep the metal from rusting, or to make them smooth and slippery. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 1:21</a>) The leather shield was often decked with a heavy <span id=\"page171\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"171\" data-before-text=\"171\"></span>center boss (a knob or stud) of metal, which gave added protection.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Job 15:26</a>.The &#x201C;large shield&#x201D; (Heb., <em>tsin&#xB7;nah&#x2B9;</em>) was carried by the heavily armed infantry (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 14:8</a>) and sometimes by a shield bearer.

Apparently a similar &#x201C;large shield&#x201D; is designated at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Ephesians 6:16</a> by the Greek word <em>thy&#xB7;re&#xB7;os&#x2B9; </em>(from <em>thy&#x2B9;ra, </em>meaning &#x201C;door&#x201D;). The <em>tsin&#xB7;nah&#x2B9; </em>was large enough to cover the entire body. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 5:12</a>) It was on occasion used to set up solid-front battle lines with lances protruding. The large shield is sometimes mentioned with the lance or spear as a form of reference to weapons in general.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 12:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/61/1\" data-bid=\"62-2\" class=\"b\"> 34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/61/2\" data-bid=\"62-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 11:12</a>.The smaller &#x201C;shield&#x201D; or &#x201C;buckler&#x201D; (Heb., <em>ma&#xB7;ghen&#x2B9;</em>) was customarily carried by archers and is usually associated with light weapons such as the bow. For instance, it was carried by Benjaminite bowmen of Judean King Asa&#x2019;s military force. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 14:8</a>) The smaller shield was usually round and more common than the large shield, probably being used chiefly in hand-to-hand fighting. That the Hebrew <em>tsin&#xB7;nah&#x2B9; </em>and <em>ma&#xB7;ghen&#x2B9; </em>differed considerably in size seems to be indicated by the gold shields Solomon made, the large shield being overlaid with four times as much gold as the smaller shield, or buckler.

The coat of mail (Heb., <em>shir&#xB7;yohn&#x2B9; </em>or <em>shir&#xB7;yan&#x2B9;</em>) consisted of a cloth or leather cloak that had hundreds of small adjoining pieces of metal (somewhat like fish scales) attached to its surface. Often it covered the breast, back, and shoulders, though it sometimes reached to the knees or even the ankles.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000375/71/0\" data-bid=\"72-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:5</a>.Among the Hebrews the coat of mail was frequently made of leather covered with metal scales or plates. The wearer enjoyed considerable protection thereby, but, nonetheless, would be <span id=\"page172\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"172\" data-before-text=\"172\"></span>vulnerable where the scales were connected or where the coat of mail adjoined other parts of the armor.
