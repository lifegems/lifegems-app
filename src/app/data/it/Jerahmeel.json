The royal and Messianic lineage passed through Jerahmeel&#x2019;s brother Ram (apparently the same as Arni). An extensive genealogy is included for Jerahmeel&#x2019;s descendants, some of whom inhabited the southern part of Judah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 2:4, 5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 9-15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 25-42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 27:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> Lu 3:33</a>.<strong>2. </strong>Son or descendant of a Merarite Levite named Kish.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 24:26,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 23:21</a>.<strong>3. </strong>One of the three men sent by King Jehoiakim in his fifth year to seize Jeremiah and Baruch. They returned empty-handed, however, for Jehovah kept his faithful servants concealed.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 36:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002416/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;26</a>.Since Jehoiakim&#x2019;s successor and presumed firstborn Jehoiachin was only about 12 years old during his father&#x2019;s fifth year of rule, other sons of Jehoiakim were likely still younger, too young to be sent on such a mission as Jerahmeel&#x2019;s.
