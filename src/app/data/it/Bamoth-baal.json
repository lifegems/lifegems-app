(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000550/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 22:41</a>) Balak&#x2019;s selection of this location for the enacting of the curse and the accompanying sacrifices may indicate that it was a center for Baal worship, evidently situated in an elevated place. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000550/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 23:1-9</a>) Thereafter, Bamoth-baal and other towns &#x201C;on the tableland&#x201D; were assigned to the tribe of Reuben as an inheritance.

King Mesha of Moab states that he rebuilt &#x201C;Beth-bamoth, for it had been destroyed.&#x201D; (Line 27 of the Moabite Stone) It seems likely that Bamoth, Bamoth-baal, and Beth-bamoth were all names of the same place.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare Baal-meon, Beon, Beth-baal-meon in the article on <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000550/0\">BAAL-MEON</a>.The description given in the Bible account indicates a place on the plateau region toward the NE corner of the Dead Sea. While the identification is only tentative, a suggested location is that of Khirbet Quweijiya, about 14&#xA0;km (9&#xA0;mi) E of the Dead Sea, near the probable location of Mount Nebo."}
