He was the father of Zuriel, chieftain of the paternal house of the clan at the time of the Exodus.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 3:35</a>.<strong>2. </strong>The wife of Abishur, who was of the tribe of Judah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 2:29</a>) She had two sons, Ahban and Molid.<strong>3. </strong>A man of the tribe of Gad who settled in Bashan and Gilead. He was the son of Huri and a family chief or head.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 5:14-17</a>.<strong>4. </strong>The daughter of Eliab, David&#x2019;s oldest brother. (Though the Hebrew word <em>bath </em>[daughter] at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Chronicles 11:18</a> may also mean &#x201C;granddaughter.&#x201D;)The <em>King James Version </em>at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Chronicles 11:18</a> says: &#x201C;And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.&#x201D; This would make Abihail appear to be the second wife of Rehoboam. However, the original Hebrew allows for a different rendering, and hence many modern translations here read: &#x201C;Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, <em>and of </em><span id=\"page22\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"22\" data-before-text=\"22\"></span>Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.&#x201D; (See <em>RS, AT, JP, NW, JB.</em>) Concerning this, the <em>Soncino Books of the Bible </em>says in a footnote on <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Chronicles 11:18</a>: &#x201C;The conjunction is implied. Mahalath was the daughter of Jerimoth and Abihail. Some commentators regard Abihail as the name of another of Rehoboam&#x2019;s wives.&#x201D; (Edited by A.&#xA0;Cohen, London, 1952) The singular pronouns used in the following verses (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">19, 20</a>) support the view that only one wife of Rehoboam is meant in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">verse 18</a>. It therefore appears most probable that Abihail was the mother of Rehoboam&#x2019;s wife Mahalath.<strong>5. </strong>The father of Queen Esther and a descendant of Benjamin. He was the uncle of Esther&#x2019;s cousin, Mordecai. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Es 2:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:29</a>) <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000038/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Esther 2:7</a> indicates that he and his wife died when their daughter Esther was quite young and thus sometime before her marriage to King Ahasuerus."}
