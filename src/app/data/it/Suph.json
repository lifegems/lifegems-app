(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004263/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">De 1:1</a>, ftn) Instead of &#x201C;Suph,&#x201D; the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>(Bagster) and the Latin <em>Vulgate </em>read &#x201C;the Red Sea,&#x201D; perhaps because it was thought that the Hebrew word <em>yam </em>(meaning &#x201C;sea&#x201D;) had been dropped, leaving <em>Suph </em>as an abbreviation for <em>yam-suph&#x2B9; </em>(Red Sea). In such a case, the reference would be to that part of the sea called the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba. However, taken as it stands, the Hebrew Masoretic text says that Moses spoke to Israel &#x201C;on the desert plains in front of Suph.&#x201D; And <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004263/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">verse 5</a> adds that this was &#x201C;in the region of the Jordan in the land of Moab.&#x201D; Therefore, though its exact site is unknown, Suph apparently was a place E of the Jordan. It is <span id=\"page1046\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1046\" data-before-text=\"1046\"></span>tentatively identified with Khirbet Sufa, about 6&#xA0;km (3.5&#xA0;mi) SSE of Madaba."}
