It was favorably located on the road from Hazor northward at the intersection of the E-W route from Damascus to Tyre.David&#x2019;s men under Joab besieged the city when the rebel Sheba fled there. Thereupon, a wise woman, speaking for &#x201C;the peaceable and faithful ones of Israel,&#x201D; pleaded with Joab not to destroy Abel, from of old the place to inquire for wise judgments, hence &#x201C;a mother in Israel&#x201D;; meaning also, probably, a metropolis or city having dependent towns. Heeding this woman&#x2019;s advice, the inhabitants pitched Sheba&#x2019;s head over the wall, and the city was spared.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000019/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 20:14-22</a>.Instigated by Asa of Judah, Syrian Ben-hadad I struck down Abel-beth-maacah to divert Baasha of Israel from building Ramah.

Abel of Beth-maacah was captured by Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III of Assyria during the reign of Pekah, and its inhabitants were sent into exile. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000019/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 15:29</a>) This city, called in Assyrian texts Abilakka, appears in the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser&#xA0;III in the list of cities he conquered. The surrounding fertile, well-watered fields doubtless gave rise to another merited name, Abel-maim (meaning &#x201C;Watercourse of Waters&#x201D;). Its situation made it a good storage place.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000019/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 16:4</a>."}
