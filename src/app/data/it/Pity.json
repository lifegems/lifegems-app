The plural noun <em>ra&#xB7;chamim&#x2B9; </em>denotes &#x201C;pity,&#x201D; &#x201C;mercies,&#x201D; or &#x201C;inward emotions.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003506/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 43:14,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003506/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003506/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 21:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003506/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Ps 40:11</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003506/0\">MERCY</a>.) In Greek, the verb <em>splag&#xB7;khni&#x2B9;zo&#xB7;mai </em>means &#x201C;be moved with pity or compassion,&#x201D; &#x201C;have or feel pity.&#x201D; This term is drawn from the noun <em>splag&#x2B9;khna, </em>literally meaning &#x201C;intestines.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003506/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:18</a>) Since strong emotions can have an effect on the abdominal area of the body, the Greek noun <em>splag&#x2B9;khna </em>is often used to denote &#x201C;tender affections,&#x201D; or &#x201C;tender compassions.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003506/1\">AFFECTION</a>.Jehovah God set the example in manifesting pity for those in distress, and he can move men to show this loving feeling.
