Jehovah is identified as the principal Savior, the only Source of deliverance. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 43:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 45:21</a>) He was the Savior and Deliverer of Israel, time and again. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 106:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> Isa 43:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/1/4\" data-bid=\"2-5\" class=\"b\"> 45:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/1/5\" data-bid=\"2-6\" class=\"b\"> Jer 14:8</a>) He saved not only the nation but also individuals who served him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 22:1-3</a>) Often his salvation was through men raised up by him as saviors. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 9:27</a>) During the period of the Judges, these special saviors were divinely selected and empowered to deliver Israel from foreign oppression. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 2:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;15</a>) While the judge lived, he served to keep Israel in the right way, and this brought them relief from their enemies. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 2:18</a>) When Jesus was on earth, Jehovah was his Savior, supporting and strengthening him to maintain integrity through his strenuous trials.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 5:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 28:8</a>.Along with his role as Savior, Jehovah is also the &#x201C;Repurchaser.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 49:26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 60:16</a>) In the past he redeemed his people Israel from captivity. In delivering Christians from sin&#x2019;s bondage, he does the repurchasing through his Son Jesus Christ (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 4:14</a>), Jehovah&#x2019;s provision for salvation, who is therefore exalted as &#x201C;Chief Agent and Savior.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003848/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 5:31</a>) Accordingly, Jesus Christ can rightly be called &#x201C;our Savior,&#x201D; even though he performs the salvation as the agent of Jehovah.
