Indicative of Goliath&#x2019;s size and strength was the weight of his armor. His copper coat of mail weighed 5,000 shekels (57&#xA0;kg; 126&#xA0;lb); the iron blade of his spear weighed 600 shekels (6.8 kg; 15&#xA0;lb).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001675/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:4-7</a>.<span id=\"page929\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"929\" data-before-text=\"929\"></span>Besides Og and Goliath, there were other unusually large men of the Rephaim, among them being Ishbi-benob, the weight of whose spear was 300 shekels of copper (3.4 kg; 7.5&#xA0;lb) (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001675/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 21:16</a>); Saph, or Sippai (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001675/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 21:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001675/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 20:4</a>); Lahmi, Goliath&#x2019;s brother, &#x201C;the shaft of whose spear was like the beam of loom workers&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001675/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 20:5</a>); and a man of extraordinary size whose fingers and toes were in sixes, totaling 24 (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001675/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 21:20</a>).The faithless spies reported to the Israelites that in Canaan they &#x201C;saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who are from the Nephilim; so that we became in our own eyes like grasshoppers, and the same way we became in their eyes.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001675/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 13:33</a>) These men of extraordinary size, called the sons of Anak (probably meaning &#x201C;Long-Necked [that is, of tall stature]&#x201D;), were not actually Nephilim, as reported, but were only unusually tall men, for the Nephilim, the offspring of angels and women (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001675/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 6:4</a>), perished in the Flood."}
