It has been suggested that <em>moh&#xB7;qesh&#x2B9; </em>(&#x201C;snare&#x201D;; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Am 3:5</a>) denotes a snare that was operated by the birdcatcher (or a team of them), while <em>pach </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Job 22:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 91:3</a>) describes a trap that was sprung automatically upon the bird&#x2019;s entry therein. The bird was drawn into the trap by means of bait or a lure. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 7:23</a>) The Hebrew word for &#x201C;birdcatcher&#x201D; (<em>ya&#xB7;qush&#x2B9; </em>or <em>ya&#xB7;qohsh&#x2B9;</em>) comes from the root verb <em>ya&#xB7;qosh&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;lay a snare.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 50:24</a>.The birdcatcher of ancient times had to study the various habits and peculiarities of each kind of bird and employ clever methods of concealment and camouflage in placing traps. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Job 18:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 64:5,&#xA0;6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/12/2\" data-bid=\"13-3\" class=\"b\"> 140:5</a>.) Because of the placement of their eyes on each side of the head, most birds have a wider range of vision than do humans. Also, some birds can discern objects at a distance that would require the use of binoculars by men. Such vision, added to the natural cautiousness of birds, points up the truth of the proverb that &#x201C;it is for nothing that the net is spread before the eyes of anything owning wings.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 1:17</a>.Man, unable to foresee the future and limited in his ability to cope with calamity, is likened to &#x201C;birds that are being taken in a trap [Heb., <em>bap&#xB7;pach&#x2B9;</em>], .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. ensnared at a calamitous time, when it falls upon them suddenly.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000745/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 9:12</a>) The righteous are confronted with subtle snares, hidden traps, attractive lures, and bait placed in their path to draw them into the domain of the wicked who seek to bring them to moral and spiritual ruin.
