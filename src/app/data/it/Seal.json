Ancient seals consisted of a piece of hard material (stone, ivory, or wood) having engraved letters or designs in reverse. They were made in various shapes, including cones, squares, cylinders, scarabs, and animal heads. (Regarding signet or seal rings, see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/0\">RING</a>.) Those in the form of a cylinder commonly measured between 2 and 4&#xA0;cm (0.75 to 1.5&#xA0;in.) in length. When a cylinder that was engraved on its curved surface was rolled on moist clay, it produced a continuous impression in relief. Often cylinder seals were pierced through from end to end and thus could be suspended from a cord.Religious symbols, as well as plants, animals, and simple scenes, are among the things depicted on Egyptian and Mesopotamian seals. The Babylonian &#x201C;Temptation&#x201D; Seal (British Museum) shows a tree with a man seated on one side and a woman on the other, and behind the woman is an erect serpent. Often seals gave the owner&#x2019;s name and his position. For example, one seal found in Palestine reads, &#x201C;Belonging to Shema, the minister of Jeroboam.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Biblical World, </em>edited by C.&#xA0;Pfeiffer, 1966, p.&#xA0;515.Seal impressions could indicate ownership or authenticity and could prevent tampering with documents or other things that were sealed, including bags, doors, and tombs.

Perhaps the sealing was done by folding the deed closed, tying it with a cord, and then putting a lump of wax or other soft substance on the cord and impressing the soft material with a seal. If later any question would arise about the accuracy of the open copy, the deed that had been sealed before witnesses could be produced.
