The only Biblical reference to a compass is at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001015/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 44:13</a>. There the idolatrous wood-carver is said to use the measuring line, red chalk, and a wood scraper to fashion an idol. And, &#x201C;with a compass he keeps tracing it out [evidently to make sure it is well proportioned], and gradually he makes it like the representation of a man, like the beauty of mankind, to sit in a house.&#x201D; The Hebrew word for &#x201C;compass&#x201D; (<em>mechu&#xB7;ghah&#x2B9;</em>) is related to <em>chugh </em>(circle).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001015/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 8:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001015/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 40:22</a>."}
