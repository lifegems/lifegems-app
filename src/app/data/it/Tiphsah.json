(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004419/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 15:16</a>) Its exact location is not known. Khirbet Tafsah, about 10&#xA0;km (6&#xA0;mi) WSW of ancient Shechem, bears a similar name but appears to be too far from the assumed site of Tirzah to be the location of this Tiphsah."}
