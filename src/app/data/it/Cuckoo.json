Though some have identified it with the capon, the guinea hen, or the goose, lexicographer W.&#xA0;Baumgartner (<em>Hebr&#xE4;isches und Aram&#xE4;isches Lexikon zum Alten Testament, </em>Leiden, 1967, p.&#xA0;147) suggests the &#x201C;cuckoo,&#x201D; and this seems to be indicated by the Arabic name for that bird, <em>abu burbur.</em>The common cuckoo (<em>Cuculus canorus</em>) and the great spotted cuckoo (<em>Clamator glandarius</em>) both pass through Palestine on their northern migration, arriving in early March. The cuckoo is a moderate-sized bird, resembling a small hawk, with a slightly curved, sharp, pointed beak. Usually cuckoos have inconspicuous colors such as light gray or light brown to reddish-brown or black. The underparts are often whitish with narrow black bars.While some consider the cuckoo to be a rather small bird to be used on Solomon&#x2019;s menu, it may be noted that even plucked sparrows were anciently sold in Middle Eastern markets. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001081/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:29</a>) Additionally, these cuckoos were &#x201C;fattened&#x201D; ones, and concerning such <em>The American Cyclop&#xE6;dia </em>says: &#x201C;In autumn they are fat and esteemed as food; the ancients were very partial to them, and their flesh was supposed to have valuable medicinal properties.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;1883, Vol.&#xA0;V, p.&#xA0;557.The cuckoo is neither a carrion eater nor a bird of prey, but a valuable consumer of insects. It was legally &#x201C;clean&#x201D; and fit for use on Solomon&#x2019;s royal table. While &#x201C;the cuckow&#x201D; is included in the <em>King James Version </em>as among the unclean birds, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001081/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Leviticus 11:16</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001081/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>, this translation (of the Hebrew <em>sha&#x2B9;chaph</em>) is no longer considered acceptable.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001081/0\">GULL</a>."}
