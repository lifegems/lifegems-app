(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003951/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mic 1:11</a>) In this section of the prophecy, Micah makes a frequent play on words in his usage of the place-names. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003951/0\">BETH-EZEL</a>.) A tentative identification of Shaphir is with Khirbet el-Kaum, about 15&#xA0;km (9.5&#xA0;mi) W of Hebron."}
