However, instead of being prophetic of an actual statement that the king of Babylon would make, the words of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 14:13</a> reflect what his ambition and attitude would be. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 47:10</a>.) They are part of a proverbial utterance to be lifted up against the king of Babylon by restored Israelites. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 14:1-4</a>) It therefore logically follows that &#x201C;the mountain of meeting&#x201D; must be identified in the light of Scripture and not on the basis of what may have been the pagan religious conception held by Babylon&#x2019;s king. Certainly the king of Babylon would have no desire to lift up his throne above the stars of a god whom he worshiped. Also, <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 14:14</a> clearly shows that the reference is, not to one of the Babylonian gods, but to the Most High. Hence &#x201C;the mountain of meeting&#x201D; must be associated with the Most High God.In Isaiah&#x2019;s time there was only one mountain, Mount Zion (which name came to include the temple site on Mount Moriah), where God representatively met with his people. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 8:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 24:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/5/3\" data-bid=\"6-4\" class=\"b\"> Joe 3:17</a>.) It could appropriately be termed &#x201C;the mountain of meeting&#x201D; because at the sanctuary there all mature Israelite males were to appear before the face of Jehovah three times each year. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 23:17</a>) <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003126/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 48:1, 2</a> further confirms this identification by giving Mount Zion a northerly location, harmonizing with the placement of &#x201C;the mountain of meeting&#x201D; in &#x201C;the remotest parts of the north.&#x201D;"}
