It was the &#x201C;certain village&#x201D; that Jesus visited during his later Judean ministry (approximately October to December, 32&#xA0;C.E.), the location of the home of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, who became beloved friends of Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 10:38</a>) Here Jesus later performed the miracle of Lazarus&#x2019; resurrection.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 11:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 38-44</a>.Six days before Jesus&#x2019; final Passover (as the weekly Sabbath began, on Nisan 8, 33&#xA0;C.E.), Jesus arrived at Bethany. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 12:1</a>) Following the Sabbath (that is, at the beginning of Nisan&#xA0;9) he enjoyed an evening meal in the home of Simon the leper, with Martha, Mary, and Lazarus participating. This was the scene of Mary&#x2019;s anointing him with costly oil, provoking Judas&#x2019; hypocritical objections and the rebuke administered to him by Jesus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:6-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Mr 14:3-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 12:2-8</a>) By this time, too, news had reached Jerusalem that Jesus was in the vicinity, and now that the Sabbath had ended, a great crowd of the Jews flocked out to see him and the resurrected Lazarus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 12:9</a>) The next day (still on Nisan&#xA0;9) Jesus made his triumphal ride into Jerusalem, evidently over the Mount <span id=\"page293\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"293\" data-before-text=\"293\"></span>of Olives along the path from Bethany.

The site of this Bethany beyond or E of the Jordan is unknown. Some, favoring the traditional location for Jesus&#x2019; baptism, would place it across the Jordan opposite Jericho. However, the record at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">John 1:29,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 35,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/15/2\" data-bid=\"16-3\" class=\"b\"> 43;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/15/3\" data-bid=\"16-4\" class=\"b\"> 2:1</a> seems to indicate a place no more than a day&#x2019;s journey from Cana of Galilee; while that of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">John 10:40</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">11:3,</a> <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">6,</a> <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000670/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">17</a> may suggest that it lay about two days&#x2019; journey from the Bethany that was the home of Lazarus. Thus, a site somewhat S of the Sea of Galilee seems the most likely, but no positive identification is possible."}
