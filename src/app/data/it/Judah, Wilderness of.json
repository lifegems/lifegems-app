(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002539/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:16</a>) This wilderness region, extending about 16 to 24&#xA0;km (10 to 15&#xA0;mi) in width, begins not far E of the Mount of Olives and stretches some 80&#xA0;km (50&#xA0;mi) along the W coast of the Dead Sea. It mainly consists of smooth and rounded barren hills of soft chalk, cleft by torrent valleys and ravines. (PICTURE, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;335) Toward the Dead Sea the rounded hills give way to rocky gorges, and the sea itself is faced by a wall of jagged cliffs. Dropping some 1,200&#xA0;m (3,900&#xA0;ft) in 24&#xA0;km (15&#xA0;mi), this wilderness is shielded from the rain-bearing W winds and therefore receives only limited rainfall. At the same time it is at the mercy of the dry winds that sweep in from the E.&#xA0;But when it does rain, water rushes through the otherwise dry torrent valleys, and for a few weeks in the rainy season the wilderness produces meager vegetation.David, who sought refuge from Saul in the Wilderness of Judah, described it as &#x201C;a land dry and exhausted, where there is no water.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002539/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ps&#xA0;63:Sup,&#xA0;1</a>) No stream has its source in the heart of this arid region, and no surface water runs there. In sharp contrast, the stream issuing forth from Ezekiel&#x2019;s visionary temple flowed through this wilderness and supported trees in abundance along its banks.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002539/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 47:1-10</a>.It was undoubtedly into the desolate Wilderness of Judah that the &#x2018;goat for Azazel&#x2019; was sent on the annual Atonement Day after being led there from the temple at Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002539/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Le 16:21,&#xA0;22</a>) In the first century C.E., John the Baptizer began his ministry in a section of this region N of the Dead Sea. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002539/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 3:1-6</a>) Apparently somewhere in this same wilderness Christ Jesus was tempted by the Devil.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002539/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:1</a>."}
