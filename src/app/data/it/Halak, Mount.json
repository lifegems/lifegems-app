The range that begins with Jebel Halaq divides the pastureland on the E from the sandy desert on the W.&#xA0;If this identification is correct, then the Biblical description of Halak as &#x2018;going up,&#x2019; or &#x2018;rising,&#x2019; toward Seir may mean that the broad side of this mountain, running from SW to NE, faces Seir."}
