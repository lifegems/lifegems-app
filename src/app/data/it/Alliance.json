An alliance usually implies resultant mutual benefit or the joint pursuit of a desired purpose. The Hebrew word <em>cha&#xB7;var&#x2B9; </em>literally means &#x201C;be joined&#x201D; but is used figuratively to mean &#x201C;be allied; have partnership.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 28:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 94:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 20:35</a>) The related <em>cha&#xB7;ver&#x2B9; </em>denotes an ally or partner.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 20:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 119:63</a>.Abraham entered into an early alliance with Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner of the Amorites. The nature of the confederacy is not stated, but they joined him in his march to rescue his nephew Lot from invading kings. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:13-24</a>) Abraham was then dwelling as an alien in land controlled by petty kingdoms, and in this case, some formal declaration in the form of a covenant may have been required of him as a prerequisite for peaceful residence in their midst. However, Abraham avoided unnecessarily obligating himself to such political rulers, as is manifest by his statement to the king of Sodom at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 14:21-24</a>. Later, at Gerar, the Philistine king Abimelech reminded Abraham of his alien status and that he resided in the land of Philistia by Abimelech&#x2019;s consent, and he requested of him the swearing of an oath guaranteeing faithful conduct. Abraham acquiesced and later, following a water-rights dispute, made a covenant with Abimelech.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 20:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000198/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:22-34</a>.Abraham&#x2019;s son Isaac also came to dwell in Gerar, although he was later asked by Abimelech to move out of the immediate vicinity, and he willingly complied. Disputes over water rights again occurred, but thereafter Abimelech and his chief associates approached Isaac requesting an oath of obligation and a covenant, doubtless as a renewal of that made with Abraham. Sworn statements were made by both parties guaranteeing reciprocal peaceful conduct.
