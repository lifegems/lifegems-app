(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000612/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 9:3-17</a>) The city thereafter was included within the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000612/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 4:2-6</a>) Mention is made of the flight of its residents to Gittaim, but the reason is not explained; it may have been due to Philistine raids following their victory over Saul&#x2019;s forces at Mount Gilboa, or it may have taken place after the assassination of Ish-bosheth, the flight being to avoid <span id=\"page277\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"277\" data-before-text=\"277\"></span>acts of vengeance in reprisal for that murder. However, following the exile in Babylon, men of Beeroth are listed among those returning to the land of Judah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000612/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 2:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000612/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000612/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Ne 7:29</a>.Though some suggest Khirbet el Burj or Nabi Samwil to the S, others suggest el Bira, a neighboring town of modern Ramallah, located about 14&#xA0;km (9&#xA0;mi) N of Jerusalem and about 8&#xA0;km (5&#xA0;mi) NNE of Gibeon, hence, near the border of Ephraim. A spring there provides a fine supply of water. Traces of an old caravansary indicate that it was a stopping place for caravans."}
