In the Bible the title most often refers to women outside the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The Hebrew word most nearly expressing the idea of queen as it is understood today is <em>mal&#xB7;kah&#x2B9;. </em>But it was rare in the Orient for a woman to possess ruling authority. The queen of Sheba may have been one with such power.

Vashti, as the chief wife of King Ahasuerus of Persia, was a consort queen rather than a ruling one. She was replaced by the Jewess Esther, making Esther consort queen, and while Esther had royal dignity, she was not an associate ruler (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Es 1:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 2:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/2/4\" data-bid=\"3-5\" class=\"b\"> 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/2/5\" data-bid=\"3-6\" class=\"b\"> 4:11</a>); any authority she might have had was by the king&#x2019;s grant.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Es 8:1-8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:29-32</a>.<strong>Israel. </strong>The Hebrew word <em>gevi&#xB7;rah&#x2B9;, </em>translated &#x201C;queen&#x201D; in some versions, means, more correctly, &#x201C;lady&#x201D; or &#x201C;mistress.&#x201D; In the instances where the title is used, it seems to apply mainly to the mother or grandmother of the king, such women being given royal respect, for example, Jezebel the mother of King Jehoram of Israel.

As the queen mother, she possessed a certain amount of royal dignity and was greatly respected by all, including Belshazzar.<strong>Egypt. </strong>Early Egyptian heads of state were men. &#x201C;Queens&#x201D; were actually consorts.

Hatshepsut ruled as queen only because she refused to surrender her regency when the heir, Thutmose&#xA0;III, became of age.

Later, however, during the time of Ptolemaic (Macedonian) reign over Egypt, there were ruling queens.<strong>In False Worship. </strong>The apostate Israelites of Jeremiah&#x2019;s day forsook Jehovah, their real King, and idolatrously made cakes, drink offerings, and sacrificial smoke to the &#x201C;queen [Heb., <em>mele&#x2B9;kheth</em>] <span id=\"page721\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"721\" data-before-text=\"721\"></span>of the heavens.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 7:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> 44:17, 18</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/0\">QUEEN OF THE HEAVENS</a>.Babylon the Great is shown, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 18:7</a>, to be saying boastfully, &#x201C;I sit a queen [Gr., <em>ba&#xB7;si&#x2B9;lis&#xB7;sa</em>],&#x201D; sitting on &#x201C;peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Re 17:15</a>) She maintains her control through her immoral relations with earthly rulers, even as did many queens of the past.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Re 17:1-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/14/1\" data-bid=\"15-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/14/2\" data-bid=\"15-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/1\">BABYLON THE GREAT</a>.<strong>&#x201C;Queenly Consort&#x201D; in Heaven. </strong>Since <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Hebrews 1:8, 9</a> applies <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 45:6, 7</a> to Christ Jesus, it seems likely that &#x201C;the king&#x2019;s daughter&#x201D; of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003605/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 45:13</a> is prophetic of his bride class.
