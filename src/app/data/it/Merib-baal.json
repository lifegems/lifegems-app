(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003000/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 8:33,&#xA0;34</a>) This is apparently another name for Mephibosheth. Other persons also had two names, such as Eshbaal, also called Ish-bosheth.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003000/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 2:8</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003000/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 8:33</a>.The name Merib-baal is found in two somewhat different Hebrew forms (<em>Meriv&#x2B9; ba&#x2B9;&#x2BD;al </em>and <em>Meri-va&#x2B9;&#x2BD;al</em>) at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003000/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 9:40</a>. The first form is also used at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003000/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 8:34</a>. Indicating similar identity is the fact that Mephibosheth had a boy named Mica and Merib-baal had a son named Micah. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003000/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 9:12</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003000/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 9:40</a>.) The forms &#x201C;Mica&#x201D; and &#x201C;Micah&#x201D; are due merely to a slight variation in the Hebrew spelling of these names."}
