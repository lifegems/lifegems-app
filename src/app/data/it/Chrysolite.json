It generally occurs in volcanic rocks (also, in dolomite and some types of limestone) in solid, crystalline, or granular form. &#x201C;Chrysolite&#x201D; is from the Greek word <em>khry&#xB7;so&#x2B9;li&#xB7;thos, </em>meaning &#x201C;gold stone,&#x201D; and it seems that at least some ancients applied this name to various yellow-colored gems. Fine-quality chrysolite crystals are found in Egypt.In compliance with Jehovah&#x2019;s instructions, a chrysolite (Heb., <em>tar&#xB7;shish&#x2B9;; LXX, khry&#xB7;so&#x2B9;li&#xB7;thos</em>) was placed in the first position in the fourth row on Aaron&#x2019;s &#x201C;breastpiece of judgment&#x201D; to represent one of the 12 tribes of Israel.
