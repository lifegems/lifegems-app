The most common Hebrew word for anger is <em>&#x2BC;aph, </em>basically meaning &#x201C;nose; nostril&#x201D; but often used figuratively for &#x201C;anger&#x201D; because of the violent breathing or snorting of an enraged person. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000278/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 18:7,&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000278/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Eze 38:18</a>.) Related to <em>&#x2BC;aph </em>is <em>&#x2BC;a&#xB7;naph&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;be incensed.&#x201D; Anger is also often associated in the Hebrew Scriptures with heat and thus is said to blaze. Other Hebrew words are rendered &#x201C;rage,&#x201D; &#x201C;fury,&#x201D; and &#x201C;indignation.&#x201D; In the Christian Greek Scriptures <em>or&#xB7;ge&#x2B9; </em>is generally translated &#x201C;wrath,&#x201D; while <em>thy&#xB7;mos&#x2B9; </em>is usually rendered &#x201C;anger.&#x201D;<strong>God&#x2019;s Anger. </strong>Anger may be justified or unjustified. On God&#x2019;s part, his anger is always justified, being based on principle dictated by his right to exclusive devotion and his constancy in upholding truth; it is governed by his love for righteousness and for those practicing righteousness. Divine anger does not stem from a momentary whim, to be later regretted. Jehovah sees all the issues involved in a matter and has complete, entire knowledge of a situation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000278/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 4:13</a>) He reads the heart; he notes the degree of ignorance, negligence, or willful sin; and he acts with impartiality.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000278/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">De 10:17, 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000278/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 16:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000278/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Ac 10:34,&#xA0;35</a>.<strong><em>Principles controlling divine wrath. </em></strong>God&#x2019;s anger is always under control and in harmony with his attributes of love, wisdom, and justice. Because of his almighty power it is expressible to the degree he desires.

It is fully based on sufficient cause and always takes effect. His anger is satisfied and quieted only by the application of his principles. For example, in Israel a willful murderer could not be ransomed. Only by the shedding of his blood could the land be cleansed and freed from God&#x2019;s displeasure.

God&#x2019;s wrath is against all unrighteousness. He will not tolerate unrighteousness or exempt from punishment one deserving it.

He may use his laws governing natural things, or he may use other persons as instruments to express his anger. Those who violate his moral laws are under his wrath and receive in themselves &#x201C;the full recompense, which was due for their error.&#x201D; These suffer a disapproved mental state, degradation, diseases, strife, and death.
