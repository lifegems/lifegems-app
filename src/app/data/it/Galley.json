On it no galley fleet [literally, fleet of ships of oar] will go, and no majestic ship will pass over it. For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Statute-giver, Jehovah is our King; he himself will save us.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001601/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 33:21,&#xA0;22</a>) Jerusalem had no great rivers or canals as defenses against attack. Yet, just as rivers and canals protected cities such as Babylon and No-amon (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001601/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Na 3:8</a>), Jehovah would protect Jerusalem. So powerful would these &#x201C;rivers&#x201D; of God&#x2019;s salvation be that strong enemy forces, symbolized by a fleet of hostile galleys or a majestic ship, would be wrecked in the mighty &#x201C;waters&#x201D; if they came up against Jerusalem. Jehovah thereby assured Jerusalem, in a figurative way, of her security under the defense he himself, ruling as her King, would provide for her salvation."}
