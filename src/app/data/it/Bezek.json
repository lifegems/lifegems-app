(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000722/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 1:3-7</a>) Some identify this Bezek with that of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000722/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 11:8</a> (No.&#xA0;2 below), which is in an extreme northern location in relation to Jerusalem and the territory occupied by Judah and Simeon. Such a view would require the assumption that Adoni-bezek came S to join other Canaanite forces but was met by Judah and Simeon, was chased N to Bezek, and was defeated there. The context, however, seems to indicate a place in the general area of Jerusalem. In view of these circumstances, Bezek, the city of Adoni-bezek, is tentatively located in the Shephelah region at the site of Khirbet Bezqa, about 5&#xA0;km (3&#xA0;mi) NE of Gezer.<strong>2. </strong>The location where Saul assembled the sons of Israel and Judah to fight against the Ammonites who were camped against Jabesh in Gilead. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000722/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 11:8-11</a>) The fact that this place was no more than a night&#x2019;s march from Jabesh substantiates the view that it was located at the modern site of Khirbet Ibziq, 21&#xA0;km (13&#xA0;mi) NE of Shechem. A mountain W of Khirbet Ibziq rises 713&#xA0;m (2,339&#xA0;ft) above sea level and may have provided a suitable place for Saul to gather his forces."}
