(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002764/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 9:32-38</a>) Situated in a fertile valley at the southern edge of the Plain of Sharon, el-Ludd (Lod) is about 18&#xA0;km (11&#xA0;mi) SE of Joppa. Its location anciently placed the city at the intersection of what is considered to have been the principal route between Egypt and Babylon and the <span id=\"page262\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"262\" data-before-text=\"262\"></span>main road from Joppa to Jerusalem. During the Common Era this strategic position exposed the city to ravages by the armies of the Romans, Saracens, Crusaders, and Mongols."}
