Though today the term &#x201C;grave&#x201D; is generally understood to apply to an excavation in the earth for use as a place of burial, a common method of burial among the Hebrews and other Oriental peoples was by use of a natural cave or a rock-cut tomb, or vault. The Hebrew word <em>qe&#x2B9;ver </em>is the common word used to designate a burial place, a grave, or a graveyard.

They are, therefore, distinct from the Hebrew <em>she&#x2BC;ohl&#x2B9; </em>and its Greek equivalent <em>hai&#x2B9;des, </em><span id=\"page995\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"995\" data-before-text=\"995\"></span>which refer to the common grave of mankind, or gravedom, and hence are always used in the singular. For this reason many modern translations have not followed the practice of the <em>King James Version, </em>in which <em>she&#x2BC;ohl&#x2B9; </em>and <em>hai&#x2B9;des </em>are alternately rendered by the words &#x201C;hell,&#x201D; &#x201C;grave,&#x201D; and &#x201C;pit,&#x201D; but have instead simply transliterated them into English.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/0\">HADES</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/1\">SHEOL</a>.Nevertheless, since one&#x2019;s entry into Sheol is represented as taking place through burial in an individual grave or at a burial site, words pertaining to such places of interment are used as <em>parallel </em>though not <em>equivalent </em>terms with Sheol.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 17:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 13-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:13,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/6/3\" data-bid=\"7-4\" class=\"b\"> 32, 33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/6/4\" data-bid=\"7-5\" class=\"b\"> Ps 88:3-12</a>.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 3:13</a> the apostle Paul quotes <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 5:9</a>, likening the throat of wicked and deceitful men to &#x201C;an opened grave.&#x201D; As an opened grave is to be filled with the dead and with corruption, their throat opens for speech that is deadly and corrupt.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001759/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 15:18-20</a>.It was a custom to whitewash graves so that persons would not accidentally touch them and become unclean. The tombs near Jerusalem were whitewashed one month before Passover to prevent a person from becoming unclean at this special period of worship by accidentally touching a grave.
