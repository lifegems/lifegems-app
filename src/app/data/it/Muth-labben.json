One possibility of the word&#x2019;s meaning is advanced by the Targum, in which the <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003140/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">superscription of Psalm 9</a> reads: &#x201C;On the death of the man who came forth from between the camps,&#x201D; alluding to a champion. The apparent reference here is to Goliath, the Philistine champion whom David defeated in battle between the Israelite and Philistine encampments.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003140/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 17:45-51</a>."}
