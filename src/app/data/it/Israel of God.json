(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 32:22-28</a>) The Bible speaks of &#x201C;Israel in a fleshly way&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 10:18</a>), as well as spiritual Israel made up of those for whom descent from Abraham is not a requirement. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 3:9</a>) The apostle Paul, when using the expression &#x201C;the Israel of God,&#x201D; shows that it has nothing to do with whether one is a circumcised descendant of Abraham or not.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 6:15,&#xA0;16</a>.The prophet Hosea foretold that God, in rejecting the nation of natural Israel in favor of this spiritual nation, which includes Gentiles, would say &#x201C;to those not my people: &#x2018;You are my people.&#x2019;&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 2:23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 9:22-25</a>) In due time the Kingdom of God was taken away from the nation of natural Jews and given to a spiritual nation bringing forth Kingdom fruitage. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 21:43</a>) To be sure, natural Jews were included in spiritual Israel. The apostles and others who received holy spirit at Pentecost in 33&#xA0;C.E. (about 120), those added on that day (about 3,000), and those that later increased the number of the men alone to about 5,000 were all Jews and proselytes. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 1:13-15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 4:4</a>) But even at that, they were, as Isaiah described them, &#x201C;a mere remnant&#x201D; saved out of that cast-off nation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 10:21, 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 9:27</a>.Other scriptures elaborate on this matter. With the breaking off of some &#x201C;natural branches&#x201D; of the figurative olive tree, there was a grafting in of &#x201C;wild&#x201D; non-Israelite ones, so that there was no racial or class distinction among those that &#x201C;are really Abraham&#x2019;s seed, heirs with reference to a promise.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 11:17-24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Ga 3:28,&#xA0;29</a>) &#x201C;Not all who spring from Israel are really &#x2018;Israel.&#x2019;&#x201D; &#x201C;For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision that which is on the outside upon the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 9:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:28,&#xA0;29</a>) Natural Israel failed to produce the required number, so God &#x201C;turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 15:14</a>), concerning whom it was said, &#x201C;You were once not a people, but are now God&#x2019;s people.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 2:10</a>) The apostle Peter quoted what had been said to natural Israel and applied it to this spiritual Israel of God, saying it is in reality &#x201C;a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 19:5,&#xA0;6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 2:9</a>.The 12 tribes mentioned in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation chapter&#xA0;7</a> must refer to this spiritual Israel for several valid reasons. The listing does not match that of natural Israel at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Numbers chapter&#xA0;1</a>. Also Jerusalem&#x2019;s temple and priesthood and all the tribal records of natural Israel were permanently destroyed, lost forever, long before John had his vision in 96&#xA0;C.E. But more important, John received his vision upon a background of the aforementioned developments from and after Pentecost 33&#xA0;C.E. In the light of such events, John&#x2019;s vision of those standing on the heavenly Mount Zion with the Lamb (whom natural Israel had rejected) revealed the number of this spiritual Israel of God to be 144,000 &#x201C;bought from among mankind.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Re 7:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 14:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002229/15/2\" data-bid=\"16-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;4</a>."}
