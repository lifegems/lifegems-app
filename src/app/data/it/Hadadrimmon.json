(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001799/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 12:11</a>) Hadadrimmon is often identified with Rummana, a site about 7&#xA0;km (4.5 mi) SSE of Megiddo.The &#x2018;great wailing&#x2019; at Hadadrimmon mentioned in Zechariah&#x2019;s prophecy perhaps alludes to the lamentation over King Josiah, killed in battle at Megiddo. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001799/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 23:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001799/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 35:24,&#xA0;25</a>) But some associate this lamentation with ritualistic mourning ceremonies like those for the false god Tammuz (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001799/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 8:14</a>) and consider &#x201C;Hadadrimmon&#x201D; to be the composite name of a god. This is unlikely, especially since Jehovah&#x2019;s words, through Zechariah, are part of a prophecy concerning the Messiah. Hardly could idolatrous weeping ceremonies serve as a prophetic illustration; but the mourning for a faithful Judean king could well do so.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001799/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:37</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001799/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Re 1:7</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001799/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 12:10-14</a>."}
