For instance, &#x201C;ring-shaped cakes&#x201D; (Heb., <em>chal&#xB7;lohth&#x2B9;</em>) were used at the time of the installing of Israel&#x2019;s priesthood (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 29:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;23</a>), and Tamar prepared &#x201C;heart-shaped cakes.&#x201D; (Heb., <em>levi&#xB7;vohth&#x2B9;; </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 13:8</a>, ftn; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/0\">LOAF</a>.) Abraham told Sarah to make &#x201C;round cakes&#x201D; (Heb., <em>&#x2BD;u&#xB7;ghohth&#x2B9;</em>) to feed the materialized angels that visited him.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 18:6</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ki 19:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Eze 4:12</a>.Through the prophet Hosea, Jehovah said: &#x201C;Ephraim himself has become a round cake not turned on the other side.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 7:8</a>) Ephraim (Israel) had mingled with pagan peoples, adopting their ways and also seeking alliances with heathen nations, and consequently was like a cake not turned. It was not uncommon to bake cakes on hot ashes or hot stones. If such cakes were not turned, they might be baked or even burned on one side and not baked at all on the other side.During Israel&#x2019;s Passover celebration &#x201C;unfermented cakes&#x201D; (yeastless, or unleavened, bread; Heb., <em>mats&#xB7;tsohth&#x2B9;</em>) were to be eaten, and associated with this observance was &#x201C;the festival of unfermented cakes.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 12:8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 15,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 17-20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/3\" data-bid=\"6-4\" class=\"b\"> 13:3-7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/4\" data-bid=\"6-5\" class=\"b\"> 23:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/5\" data-bid=\"6-6\" class=\"b\"> 34:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/6\" data-bid=\"6-7\" class=\"b\"> De 16:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/7\" data-bid=\"6-8\" class=\"b\"> 8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000859/5/8\" data-bid=\"6-9\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;16</a>) Unfermented ring-shaped cakes moistened with oil or unfermented wafers that were smeared with oil were among the offerings Israel was to make to Jehovah God.
