(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002843/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 18:11,&#xA0;12</a>) Some believe that these are two different sites, since the suggested locations for Eshtaol and Zorah are a number of miles SW of Kiriath-jearim. In any event, the location(s) of Mahaneh-dan is unknown. Its name means &#x201C;Camp of Dan&#x201D; and, therefore, perhaps simply denoted a temporary settlement or a campsite and understandably could have applied to more than one place."}
