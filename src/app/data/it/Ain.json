It is often written &#x201C;En-&#x201D; when used in compounds, as En-rimmon, En-gedi, En-gannim.<strong>1. </strong>A place mentioned by Jehovah when setting out the E boundary of Israel to Moses.

It lay to the N of that sea, but its exact location is uncertain.<strong>2. </strong>One of the southernmost cities originally assigned to the tribe of Judah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000183/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 15:32</a>), then assigned to the tribe of Simeon when Simeon&#x2019;s allotment was taken out from Judah&#x2019;s overly large territory.
