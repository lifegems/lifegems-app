For example, at the time of numbering the Israelites in the wilderness, four families were regarded as making up the paternal house of Kohath.

Several paternal houses constituted a tribe (such as the tribe of Levi, made up of the paternal houses of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari).The terms &#x201C;paternal house,&#x201D; or &#x201C;fathers&#x2019; house,&#x201D; &#x201C;house of our father,&#x201D; and so forth, were not always limited to the above usages, however.

The priests were organized by David into 24 divisions of service according to their paternal houses, 16 divisions for Eleazar and 8 for Ithamar. The 24 headmen were called &#x201C;heads for their paternal houses.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001497/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 24:4-6</a>) The rest of the Levites were selected for certain duties by lot, without regard to any priority of age of the heads of their paternal houses.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001497/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 24:20-31</a>.Each Israelite paternal house was represented by its hereditary head in connection with official tribal business and the administration of justice.
