(See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/0\">MUSIC</a>.) About one tenth of the entire Bible is song, the foremost examples being the Psalms, The Song of Solomon, and Lamentations. While the Scriptures do refer to secular songs, songs of contempt and of seduction, the majority of the Bible&#x2019;s some 300 references to the subject relate to the worship of Jehovah God. In the main, singing is associated with joy, as when the disciple James wrote: &#x201C;Is there anyone in good spirits? Let him sing psalms [songs of praise to God].&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 5:13</a>) Songs expressing sorrow might more properly be termed dirges.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Am 8:10</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/1\">DIRGE</a>.The first song recorded in the Bible was that sung by Moses and the men of Israel, to which Miriam and the women responded, upon their deliverance at the Red Sea. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 15:1-21</a>) Among others are Moses&#x2019; farewell song, Deborah and Barak&#x2019;s victory song, and David&#x2019;s dirge lamenting the death of Saul and David&#x2019;s dear friend Jonathan. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">De 31:30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 32:1-43;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> Jg 5:1-31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 1:17-27</a>) Additional compositions of David include at least 73 of the Psalms. The Bible also refers to &#x201C;the song of Jehovah,&#x201D; mentioned in connection with Hezekiah&#x2019;s restoration of pure worship, as well as the &#x2018;song of Moses and the Lamb.&#x2019;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 29:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Re 15:3,&#xA0;4</a>.References to &#x201C;a new song&#x201D; appear not only in the Psalms but also in the writings of Isaiah and the apostle John.

As joyfully proclaimed in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 96:10</a>: &#x201C;Jehovah himself has become king.&#x201D; The new developments in Jehovah&#x2019;s extension of his kingship, as well as what these signify for heaven and earth, appear to be the subject of this &#x201C;new song.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 96:11-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 98:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> Isa 42:10,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/7/3\" data-bid=\"8-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>."}
