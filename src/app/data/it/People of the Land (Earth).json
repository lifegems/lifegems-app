In Jesus&#x2019; day it was employed by the religious leaders as a term of contempt, but originally this was not the case.The Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon by Koehler and Baumgartner explains this Hebrew expression to mean &#x201C;the citizens possessing the full rights.&#x201D; (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;711) <em>The Interpreter&#x2019;s Dictionary of the Bible </em>states that the term &#x201C;in the strict sense includes only the responsible male citizenry, the married men who live on their own land and have full rights and duties, including the duty of serving in the army and of participating in judicial proceedings and .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. festivals.&#x201D; (Edited by G.&#xA0;A.&#xA0;Buttrick, 1962, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;106) (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Le 20:2-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 15:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 16:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Eze 45:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/0/5\" data-bid=\"1-6\" class=\"b\"> 46:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/0/6\" data-bid=\"1-7\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9</a>.) Thus, originally, the expression was one of respect.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 15:1,&#xA0;2</a>) The term expressed the contemptuous attitude exemplified in the statement of the Pharisees at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">John 7:49</a>: &#x201C;This crowd that does not know the Law are accursed people.&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua said that an <em>&#x2BD;am ha&#xB7;&#x2BC;a&#x2B9;rets </em>is: &#x201C;Anyone who does not put on <em>tefillin </em>[phylacteries].&#x201D; Other rabbinic statements applying to such nonobservers of Jewish traditions were: &#x201C;Even if one has learnt Scripture and Mishnah, if he has not ministered to the disciples of the wise, he is an <em>&#x2BD;am ha-arez.&#x201D; </em>(Babylonian Talmud, <em>Berakhot </em>47<em>b, </em>translated by M.&#xA0;Simon) &#x201C;Neither is an ignorant person [<em>&#x2BD;am ha&#xB7;&#x2BC;a&#x2B9;rets</em>] pious.&#x201D; (Babylonian Talmud, <em>Avot </em>2:5, translated by J.&#xA0;Israelstam) &#x201C;The illiterate will not be resurrected.&#x201D; (Babylonian Talmud, <em>Ketubbot </em>111<em>b, </em>translated by I.&#xA0;Slotki) (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 9:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> <span id=\"page601\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"601\" data-before-text=\"601\"></span>Lu 15:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003433/17/2\" data-bid=\"18-3\" class=\"b\"> 18:11</a>.)

Pagan originally meant simply a dweller in a rural community, but since those country people were often the last to be converted, it came to be used by city dwellers as applying to all who did not adopt their professed Christian beliefs. In a similar way the term &#x201C;heathen&#x201D; at first meant simply one who lived out on the &#x201C;heath&#x201D; or field."}
