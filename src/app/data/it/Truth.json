But the fact that man&#x2019;s wrongdoing makes God&#x2019;s righteousness stand out in even greater prominence provides no basis for claiming that God is unjust in executing an adverse judgment against wrongdoers. Being a creation of God, a person has no right to harm himself by sinning.The above is the argument that Paul used in his letter to the Romans, saying: &#x201C;If our unrighteousness brings God&#x2019;s righteousness to the fore, what shall we say? God is not unjust when he vents his wrath, is he? (I am speaking as a man does.) Never may that happen! How, otherwise, will God judge the world?

This point is emphasized by the apostle Paul in his letter to the Colossians: &#x201C;Let no man judge you in eating and drinking or in respect of a festival or of an observance of the new moon or of a sabbath; for those things are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to the Christ.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Col 2:16,&#xA0;17</a>) Accordingly, &#x201C;the truth came to be through Jesus&#x201D; in the sense that he put the things foreshadowed by the Law into the realm of actual truth. As he himself was no shadow but the reality, Jesus was &#x201C;the truth.&#x201D; Jesus also became &#x2018;a minister in behalf of God&#x2019;s truthfulness&#x2019; in that he fulfilled God&#x2019;s promises made to the forefathers of the Jews by ministering to the circumcised Jews and proselytes.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 15:8</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/0\">JESUS CHRIST</a> (&#x2018;Bearing Witness to the Truth&#x2019;).Similarly, the apostle Paul&#x2019;s reference to &#x201C;the <span id=\"page1132\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1132\" data-before-text=\"1132\"></span>truth in the Law&#x201D; does not imply that there was any falsehood in it (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 2:20</a>) but shows that the Law was not the full truth.<strong>&#x201C;The Spirit of the Truth.&#x201D; </strong>The spirit that proceeds from Jehovah God is pure and holy.

This was the situation of those who insisted that circumcision was necessary in order for one to gain salvation. Their teaching was contrary to Christian truth, and those who accepted it ceased to obey the truth or walk in it.

Not all qualify to do this kind of instructing, or teaching, in the congregation. Men who have bitter jealousies and are contentious have no basis for bragging about their being qualified to teach. Their claim would be false. As the disciple James wrote: &#x201C;Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show out of his fine conduct his works with a mildness that belongs to wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and contentiousness in your hearts, do not be bragging and lying against the truth.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 3:13,&#xA0;14</a>.For the Christian congregation to be &#x201C;a pillar and support of the truth,&#x201D; the members thereof must, through fine conduct, manifest the truth in their lives. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 5:9</a>) They have to be consistent and undeviating in right conduct, as if &#x201C;girded about with truth.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 6:14</a>) Besides maintaining personal purity, Christians must be concerned about congregational purity. When emphasizing the need to keep the Christian congregation clean from the defilement of lawless persons, the apostle Paul wrote: &#x201C;Clear away the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our passover has been sacrificed. Consequently let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with leaven of badness and wickedness, but with unfermented cakes of sincerity and truth.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 5:7,&#xA0;8</a>) Since Jesus Christ was sacrificed only once (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004483/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 9:25-28</a>) as the reality of the Passover lamb, the entire life course of the Christian, comparable to the Festival of Unfermented Cakes, should be free from injuriousness and wickedness. There must be a willingness to remove what is sinful to maintain personal and congregational purity and thus to &#x2018;keep the festival with unfermented cakes of sincerity and truth.&#x2019;"}
