(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003498/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:10-12</a>) The identification of the Pishon River is conjectural, suggestions ranging from certain rivers in eastern Turkey all the way to the Ganges River of India.In the article <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003498/0\">EDEN</a> No.&#xA0;1, we mentioned the possibility that the global Flood obliterated the evidence for positive identification of the Pishon and Gihon rivers today. This, of course, does not eliminate the possibility that these rivers were still in existence and known in Moses&#x2019; day when the book of Genesis was recorded. His reference to the &#x201C;land of Havilah&#x201D; is not likely to be understood as meaning that a region was so named prior to the Flood, even as is the case with his reference to the &#x201C;land of Cush.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003498/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 2:13</a>) Rather, Moses&#x2019; references to these lands are evidently to places so named in post-Flood times and serve as geographic points commonly known in his day. In addition to whatever changes the Flood wrought, the ability of earthquakes to change the course of rivers or to wipe sections of them out must also be given consideration. Such could have occurred in post-Flood times; eastern Turkey, the probable location of Eden, is in an earthquake belt.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003498/1\">HAVILAH</a> No.&#xA0;1."}
