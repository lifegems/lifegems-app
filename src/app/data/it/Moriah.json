Earlier, his father David had purchased the site from the Jebusite Araunah (Ornan) in order to erect an altar there, as this was the divinely indicated means for ending a scourge resulting from David&#x2019;s sin in connection with the <span id=\"page433\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"433\" data-before-text=\"433\"></span>taking of a census.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 24:16-25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 21:15-28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 3:1</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/0\">ARAUNAH</a>.Ancient Jewish tradition links the temple site with the mountain in &#x201C;the land of Moriah&#x201D; where Abraham, at God&#x2019;s command, attempted to offer up Isaac. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:2</a>; see <em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>VII, 329-334 [xiii,&#xA0;4].) This would make &#x201C;the land of Moriah&#x201D; the mountainous region around Jerusalem. It was to &#x201C;the land of Moriah&#x201D; that Abraham traveled from the vicinity of Beer-sheba; and on the third day, he saw that divinely designated place from a distance.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 21:33, 34;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 22:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;19</a>.Some have objected to identifying Mount Moriah with the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, because of its distance from Beer-sheba and its lack of visibility &#x201C;from a distance.&#x201D; But it was &#x201C;to the <em>land </em>of Moriah&#x201D; that Abraham was to make a trip. On the first day, Abraham rose early, saddled his ass, split the wood, loaded it on the animal, and then began his trip. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 22:2,&#xA0;3</a>) It was &#x201C;on the third day that Abraham raised his eyes and began to see the place [the <em>land </em>of Moriah] from a distance.&#x201D; Thus, the second day was the only full day of travel. As to the visibility of Mount Moriah and the traveling distance, <em>The Illustrated Bible Dictionary </em>notes: &#x201C;However, the distance from S Philistia to Jerusalem is <em>c.&#xA0;</em>80&#xA0;km, which might well have required 3 days to traverse, and in Genesis the place in question is not a &#x2018;mount Moriah&#x2019; but one of several mountains in a land of that name, and the hills on which Jerusalem stands are visible at a distance. There is no need to doubt therefore that Abraham&#x2019;s sacrifice took place on the site of later Jerusalem, if not on the Temple hill.&#x201D; (Edited by J.&#xA0;Douglas, 1980, Vol.&#xA0;2, p.&#xA0;1025) Therefore, the trip of some 80&#xA0;km (50&#xA0;mi) on foot from Beer-sheba to Mount Moriah would conceivably have taken more than two full days.Mount Moriah evidently was far enough from the Salem of Abraham&#x2019;s time that the attempted sacrifice of Isaac did not take place in full view of the city&#x2019;s inhabitants. There is no record that these witnessed the incident or tried to interfere. That the site was somewhat isolated centuries later may be deduced from the fact that in David&#x2019;s day there was a threshing floor on Mount Moriah. However, no mention is made of any buildings on the site.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 3:1</a>.Today the Islamic shrine known as the Dome of the Rock is situated atop Mount Moriah.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003114/1\">JERUSALEM</a> (Later Periods)."}
