This valley formed the boundary between Moab and Edom, and over a 56-km (35&#xA0;mi) stretch, it descends some 1,190&#xA0;m (3,900&#xA0;ft), entering the Dead Sea at the SE end. The valley is some 5 to 6&#xA0;km (3 to 4&#xA0;mi) across at the top. There is evidence there of a series of Edomite fortresses that served to guard the natural approaches to the S of the Wadi el-Hasa&#x2BC;."}
