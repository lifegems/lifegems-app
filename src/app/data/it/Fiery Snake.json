(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001517/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">De 8:15</a>) It is first mentioned at the time of God&#x2019;s inflicting punishment on the rebellious Israelites by sending &#x201C;poisonous serpents [<em>han&#xB7;necha&#xB7;shim&#x2B9; has&#xB7;sera&#xB7;phim&#x2B9;</em>]&#x201D; among them. After Moses&#x2019; intercession, Jehovah instructed him to make &#x201C;a fiery snake&#x201D; and place it on a signal pole. If those bitten would look at it, they would be healed and would live. Moses formed the snake of copper. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001517/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 21:6-9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001517/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 10:9</a>) Jesus gave prophetic significance to this by stating: &#x201C;Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up, that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001517/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:14,&#xA0;15</a>.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001517/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 14:29</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001517/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">30:6</a> &#x201C;a flying fiery snake&#x201D; is mentioned in God&#x2019;s judgment against Philistia and in the description of the wilderness area to the S of Judah. The expression &#x201C;flying&#x201D; is considered by some to refer to the rapid darting or lightninglike striking through the air done by venomous snakes when attacking."}
