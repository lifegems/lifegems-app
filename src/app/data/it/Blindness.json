Besides a sizable number of references to it in the Bible, secular writings, such as the Ebers Papyrus from Egypt, frequently refer to the condition, describing several forms of it and its symptoms, prescribing eyewashes, and naming some of the surgical instruments used. Israel&#x2019;s law of retaliation, requiring soul for soul, <em>eye </em>for <em>eye, </em>tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, not only emphasized the sanctity of life but also impressed strongly upon the Israelites the need for extraordinary care to avoid doing injury to another. It also emphasized the need for people to be sure that any testimony they presented in court was true and accurate, since the person bearing false testimony would suffer the very punishment he would have brought on an innocent person.

Samson was blinded by the Philistines, and King Zedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar.

High Priest Eli began to lose his vision sometime before his death at the age of 98 years. Jeroboam&#x2019;s wife schemed to take advantage of the aged prophet Ahijah&#x2019;s blindness, but Jehovah thwarted the plot.

If the entire army had been struck with physical blindness, they would all have had to be led by hand. But the account simply says that Elisha told them: &#x201C;This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me.&#x201D; On this phenomenon William James in his <em>Principles of Psychology </em>(1981, Vol.&#xA0;1, p.&#xA0;59) states: &#x201C;A most interesting effect of cortical disorder is <em>mental blindness. </em>This consists not so much in insensibility to optical impressions, as in <em>inability to understand them. </em>Psychologically it is interpretable as <em>loss of associations </em>between optical sensations and what they signify; and any interruption of the paths between the optic centres and the centres for other ideas ought to bring it about.&#x201D; This was apparently the kind of blindness removed by Jehovah when the Syrian army reached Samaria. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 6:18-20</a>) Such mental blindness also may have been involved in the case of the men of Sodom, since the account shows that, instead of being distressed at loss of the faculty of sight, they persisted in trying to find the door of Lot&#x2019;s house.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 19:11</a>.Blindness disqualified a man from serving as a priest at Jehovah&#x2019;s sanctuary.

The one who put an obstacle in the way of a blind man or misled him was cursed.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 11:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/20/1\" data-bid=\"21-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:30, 31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/20/2\" data-bid=\"21-3\" class=\"b\"> 21:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/20/3\" data-bid=\"21-4\" class=\"b\"> Lu 7:21,&#xA0;22</a>) When Jesus was near Jericho he cured blind Bartimaeus and his companion.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 9:27-31</a>) Again he cured a demon-possessed man who was both blind and unable to speak. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:22</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 11:14</a>.) One man&#x2019;s sight was restored gradually. This may have been to enable the man so used to being in darkness to accommodate his eyes to the brilliance of sunlight. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 8:22-26</a>) Another man blind from birth, on having his sight restored, became a believer in Jesus.

In the case of the man blind from birth, he was told to go wash in the Pool of Siloam before he received his sight. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 9:7</a>) This was undoubtedly for a test of his faith, just as Naaman was required to bathe in the Jordan River before he was freed from his leprosy.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 5:10-14</a>.<strong>Figurative Uses. </strong>Many times the groping about of the blind serves as an illustration of helplessness.

God&#x2019;s law thoughtfully considers the blinding effect not only of a gift but also of sentiment, as it states: &#x201C;You must not treat the lowly with partiality, and you must not prefer the person of a great one.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">Le 19:15</a>) So, for sentimentality or for popularity with the crowd, a judge was not to render his verdict against the rich merely because they were rich.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 23:2,&#xA0;3</a>.<strong>Spiritual Blindness. </strong>The Bible attributes far greater importance to spiritual sight than to the physical. Jesus used the occasion of healing the man blind from birth to point out the reprehensibility of the Pharisees because they professed to be those with spiritual sight and willfully refused to come out of their blind condition. They were like those who loved darkness rather than light. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 9:39-41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000773/35/1\" data-bid=\"36-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:19,&#xA0;20</a>) The apostle Paul spoke to the Ephesian congregation about having the eyes of their heart enlightened.
