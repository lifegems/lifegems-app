(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003811/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 8:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003811/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 14:7</a>) Its precise location is uncertain, but scholars have generally recommended either of two locations, one near Beer-sheba and the other to the S of the Salt Sea.East from Beer-sheba in the Negeb is a valley the Arabic name of which (Wadi el-Milh) means Valley of Salt. The location is one where Judeans from the N and Edomites coming from the SE might conceivably meet in combat. However, some scholars, preferring a location in Edom&#x2019;s territory, identify the Scriptural Valley of Salt with a plain SSW of the Salt Sea. At present, the lowland S of the Salt Sea is quite marshy and hardly a location that would be chosen for a battle. But, since the level of the Salt Sea has risen, the plain may have been more firm at the time the battles occurred, or the fighting could have begun in a portion of the valley where the ground was not marshy. After the second conflict, 10,000 Edomites were hurled to their deaths from a crag, but the location of that crag is not stated.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003811/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 25:11,&#xA0;12</a>.In the first battle, David and Joab (evidently with Abishai in charge of at least some of the troops) struck down 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
