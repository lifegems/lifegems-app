It is not quite as hard as pure quartz, and it occurs in masses in the cavities of volcanic rocks. The common kind of chalcedony is partially transparent and figured with milky-white swirls and spots. It appears in many colors, such as white, gray, yellow, blue, and brown.Chalcedony was a stone commonly used for engraved gems in ancient times. It was named after an old Greek city called Chalcedon (in Asia Minor), which once was a source of the mineral. The only Biblical text referring to this stone states that the third foundation of New Jerusalem&#x2019;s wall was chalcedony (Gr., <em>khal&#xB7;ke&#xB7;don&#x2B9;</em>).<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000916/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Re 21:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000916/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 19</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000916/0\">JEWELS AND PRECIOUS STONES</a>."}
