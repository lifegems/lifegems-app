(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001361/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 47:8-10</a>) The name itself indicates a place by a spring. Most scholars connect En-eglaim with &#x2BD;Ain Feshka, near the NW end of the Dead Sea. &#x2BD;Ain Feshka and, some 29&#xA0;km (18&#xA0;mi) to the S, &#x2BD;Ain Jidi (which perpetuates the name of En-gedi) constitute the two major oases on the Dead Sea&#x2019;s western shore. On the other hand, others suggest a site on the SE shore of the Dead Sea, near Zoar. On the basis of ancient written documents, which refer to the district of &#x2BD;Agaltain, Y.&#xA0;Yadin concludes that &#x201C;it is clear that &#x2018;the district of &#x2BD;Agaltain&#x2019; is the south-eastern sector of the Dead Sea .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. If there is a connection between &#x2BD;Agaltain and En-eglaim in Ezekiel&#x2019;s prophecy on the Dead Sea (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001361/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ezek. 47:10</a>: &#x2018;and it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim&#x2019;)<wbr>&#x2014;the interpretation of this passage should be that the Sea will be healed from coast to coast&#x2014;<wbr>a very vivid and clear picture. There is no need to look for En-eglaim on the west coast (it was recently suggested to identify it with Ain-Feshkha), an identification that narrows the prophetic vision to the western shore alone.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Israel Exploration Journal, </em>Jerusalem, 1962, Vol.&#xA0;12, pp.&#xA0;250, 251."}
