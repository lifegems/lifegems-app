The exact limits of this region are today unknown, and the identification is uncertain. Some scholars would link &#x201C;the country of the Gerasenes&#x201D; with the area around Kursi on the E shore of the Sea of Galilee. Others suggest that the designation may apply to the large district radiating from the city of Gerasa (Jarash).<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001660/0\">GADARENES</a>."}
