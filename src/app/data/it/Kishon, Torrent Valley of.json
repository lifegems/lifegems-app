The Kishon winds its way in a northwesterly direction from the hills near Taanach through the Plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon (&#x2BD;Emeq Yizre&#x2BD;el), and, after flowing through a narrow gorge between Mount Carmel and a spur of the Galilean hills, enters the Plain of Acco (Acre) before finally emptying into the Mediterranean. The airline distance from the Kishon&#x2019;s sources to its mouth at the Bay of Acco is about 37&#xA0;km (23&#xA0;mi). Approximately 6&#xA0;m (20&#xA0;ft) wide in the spring, the portion of the Kishon flowing through the Plain of Jezreel increases in width by some 3&#xA0;m (10&#xA0;ft) in the western section of the plain. The Kishon&#x2019;s greatest width of about 20&#xA0;m (66&#xA0;ft) is reached in the Plain of Acco. With the exception of about the last 10&#xA0;km (6&#xA0;mi) of its course, the Kishon is usually dry during the summer. But in the rainy season it becomes a rushing torrent, flooding its banks and sweeping everything in its path. The plain through which the Kishon flows then becomes a marshy region.In the time of Barak and Deborah the torrent valley of Kishon figured in the deliverance of the Israelites from Canaanite oppression. Barak and his troops took a position on Mount Tabor, this action drawing army chief Sisera, with his well-equipped forces and 900 chariots, to the Kishon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002634/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:6, 7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002634/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 12,&#xA0;13</a>) The Israelites appeared to be at a military disadvantage. Yet, when directed to do so, Barak and his 10,000 men descended from Mount Tabor to engage the enemy in battle. Jehovah God then intervened. &#x201C;From heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002634/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:14, 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002634/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 5:20</a>.According to the traditional Jewish view expressed in the writings of Josephus, &#x201C;there came up a great tempest with torrents of rain and hail; and the wind drove the rain in the faces of the Canaanites, obscuring their vision, so that their bows and their slings were of no service to them.&#x201D; (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>V, 205 [v,&#xA0;4]) Such a downpour would have turned the ground to mud, immobilizing chariots and causing horses to sink into the mire and the enemy to flee in terror before Barak&#x2019;s men. By whatever means, with Jehovah&#x2019;s help, &#x201C;all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. Not as much as one remained.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002634/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 4:15, 16</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002634/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 83:9,&#xA0;10</a>.) Apparently the treacherous torrent of Kishon swept the corpses of the enemy away.
