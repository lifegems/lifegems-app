The main objection raised to the apple is that the hot, dry climate of most of Palestine is unfavorable to apple culture. However, the related Arabic word <em>tuffah </em>primarily means &#x201C;apple,&#x201D; and it is notable that the Hebrew place-names Tappuah and Beth-tappuah (probably so named because of the prevalence of this fruit in their vicinity) have been preserved in their Arabic equivalents by the use of this word.

Additionally, the possibility of some climatic variations in the past cannot be completely ruled out. Apple trees do grow in Israel today and thus seem to fit the Bible description satisfactorily. William Thomson, who spent many years in Syria and Palestine in <span id=\"page132\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"132\" data-before-text=\"132\"></span>the 19th&#xA0;century, even reported finding apple orchards in the area of Ashkelon on the Plains of Philistia.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Land and the Book, </em>revised by J.&#xA0;Grande, 1910, pp.&#xA0;545, 546.The apple tree (<em>Pyrus malus</em>) is mentioned mainly in The Song of Solomon, where the expressions of love by the Shulammite&#x2019;s shepherd companion are likened to the pleasant shade of the apple tree and the sweetness of its fruit.

The common tradition as to the apple&#x2019;s being the forbidden fruit of Eden is without any Scriptural basis whatsoever. Similarly, the expression &#x201C;apple of the eye&#x201D; is found in the <em>King James Version </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000315/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 17:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000315/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 7:2</a>; and others) but is not a Hebrew expression, the literal translation being &#x201C;the pupil of [one&#x2019;s] eyeball.&#x201D;"}
