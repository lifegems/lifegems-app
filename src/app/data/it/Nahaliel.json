Nahaliel is therefore commonly linked with one of two wadis, the Wala (a tributary of the Arnon) and the Zarqa Ma&#x2BD;in about 19&#xA0;km (12&#xA0;mi) N of the Arnon. A location on either of these wadis would fit the suggested identifications for Mattanah and Bamoth, the two Israelite encampments between which Nahaliel apparently lay."}
