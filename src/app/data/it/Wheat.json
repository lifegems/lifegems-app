(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 7:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> Re 6:6</a>.) Wheat (Heb., <em>chit&#xB7;tah&#x2B9;; </em>Gr., <em>si&#x2B9;tos</em>), either by itself or mixed with other grains, was commonly made into bread. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 29:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Eze 4:9</a>) This cereal could also be eaten raw (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 12:1</a>) and was made into grits by crushing its kernels. Especially the green ears of wheat were prepared by roasting. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Le 2:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Sa 17:28</a>) Wheat was exacted as tribute from defeated tribes or nations (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 27:5</a>), and it figured in offerings made to Jehovah.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 23:29;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Ezr 6:9,&#xA0;10</a>.The plant itself, when young, resembles grass and is bright green. Mature wheat, however, may measure from 0.6 to 1.5&#xA0;m (2 to 5&#xA0;ft) in height and is golden brown. Its leaves are long and slender, and the central stem terminates in a head of kernels. One variety of wheat (<em>Triticum compositum</em>) cultivated in Egypt of old, and still encountered there, has several ears per stalk. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004599/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 41:22,&#xA0;23</a>.) The varieties of wheat that have been commonly cultivated in Palestine in more recent years, and likely also in Bible times, are bearded, that is, they have coarse, prickly hairs on the husks of the kernels.True to God&#x2019;s promise, the Israelites found Palestine to be a land of wheat and barley.
