There is no evidence that the ancients had a secret method for hardening pure copper by tempering, but they knew how to harden the cutting edge of tools simply by cold hammering. When alloyed with <span id=\"page505\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"505\" data-before-text=\"505\"></span>other metals, hardness is greatly increased. One such alloy is bronze, copper containing tin (ancient findings having from 2 to 18&#xA0;percent tin). Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, was used by the ancients, though it was produced by methods different from those now in use. As used in the <em>King James Version, </em>&#x201C;brass&#x201D; in its older definition can include any alloy of copper.The Hebrew word <em>chash&#xB7;man&#xB7;nim&#x2B9;, </em>translated &#x201C;bronzeware things&#x201D; (<em>NW</em>) and &#x201C;bronze&#x201D; (<em>RS</em>), is found only once in the Bible. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001030/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 68:31</a>) This Hebrew word is of uncertain meaning and has been variously rendered as &#x201C;ambassadors&#x201D; (<em>JB, La</em>), &#x201C;envoys&#x201D; (<em>NIV</em>), &#x201C;nobles&#x201D; (vs 32, <em>JP</em>), &#x201C;princes&#x201D; (<em>AS, KJ</em>), and &#x201C;tribute&#x201D; (<em>NE</em>).Copper in the free state was not plentiful; metal-bearing ores consisting of oxides, carbonates, or sulfides had to be smelted to release the metallic copper. Copper mines have been located in the Wadi Arabah, that arid part of the Rift Valley that extends S from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba at the eastern head of the Red Sea.
