Where there were inner and outer walls, there were, of course, gates in each wall. Early gateways were L shaped to hinder the enemy&#x2019;s entry. Later, after the chariot was introduced (c.&#xA0;18th&#xA0;century B.C.E.), city gates had a straight, direct entrance. In some uncovered ruins the city gate is composed of an entrance flanked by square towers leading into a vestibule about some 15 to 20&#xA0;m (49 to 66&#xA0;ft) long. The passage through the vestibule was flanked by as many as six pilasters, which narrowed the passageway at three places. In some cases there may have been two or three sets of doors for these deep gates. Small rooms inside the vestibule walls were used as guard chambers. In Ezekiel&#x2019;s visionary temple, the gates were provided with guard chambers.

These were sometimes at the bottom of the rampart and provided easy access for the inhabitants of the city during peacetime. In time of siege they apparently were used as sortie gates through which the defenders could sally forth to attack besiegers and at the same time receive covering fire from their comrades on the walls.The doors of the gates of a city were usually of wood sheathed with metal plating; otherwise they could be set on fire by the enemy. Some may have been made of iron, as was the case in the days of the apostles.

We shall concern ourselves here mainly with the gates mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which gives us the most complete description or listing. The gates named in Nehemiah&#x2019;s record are gates that had been in the wall that was built prior to the eighth century B.C.E. and in the wall surrounding &#x201C;the second quarter.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 22:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/42/1\" data-bid=\"43-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 34:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/42/2\" data-bid=\"43-3\" class=\"b\"> Zep 1:10</a>) &#x201C;The second quarter&#x201D; was a northern part of the city bounded on the W and part of the N by Hezekiah&#x2019;s wall (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 32:5</a>) and joined by Manasseh&#x2019;s wall, which continued on the NE and E. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 33:14</a>) This was N of the earlier city and wall, but apparently it did not extend as far W as the earlier wall.<strong><em>Nehemiah&#x2019;s wall. </em></strong>In his account of the reconstruction of the wall of the city (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Ne&#xA0;3</a>), Nehemiah begins at the Sheep Gate and proceeds in a counterclockwise direction. We shall follow this procedure in our listing below, inserting the gates not mentioned in the reconstruction account but named in the description of the inauguration procession (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Ne&#xA0;12</a>), along with gates spoken of in other scriptures, some of which are merely other names for those in Nehemiah&#x2019;s record.<span id=\"page894\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"894\" data-before-text=\"894\"></span><strong><em>Sheep Gate. </em></strong>The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests.

Its location was probably in the wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see &#x201C;Fish Gate&#x201D; below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. &#x201C;The sheepgate&#x201D; mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool of Bethzatha.<strong><em>Fish Gate. </em></strong>Hezekiah apparently built a part of the wall around the second quarter as far as the Fish Gate.

It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with &#x201C;the First Gate&#x201D; mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying &#x201C;from [1] the Gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,&#x201D; and to the N-S limits in saying &#x201C;from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 14:10</a>) Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with &#x201C;the Middle Gate&#x201D; mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 14:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/56/1\" data-bid=\"57-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 25:23</a>) It was an exit N in the direction of the territory of Ephraim.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Zec 14:10</a>) It is thought to be (or correspond to) the Gennath or Garden Gate spoken of by the Jewish historian Josephus. (<em>The Jewish War, </em>V, 146 [iv,&#xA0;2]) Near the Gate of Ephraim there was a public square in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah&#x2019;s time. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah&#x2019;s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.<strong><em>Corner Gate. </em></strong>This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, W of the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 14:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/60/1\" data-bid=\"61-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 25:23</a>) It was on the E side of the Valley of Hinnom, apparently in the W wall of the old city at the point where it joined the Broad Wall. Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 31:38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/62/1\" data-bid=\"63-2\" class=\"b\"> Zec 14:10</a>.There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate in the SW wall, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Valley of Hinnom, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah&#x2019;s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/63/0\" data-bid=\"64-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:11</a>.<strong><em>Valley Gate. </em></strong>In the SW part of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom. The &#x201C;gate of the Essenes&#x201D; mentioned by Josephus may have been located here or nearby. (<em>The Jewish War, </em>V, 145 [iv,&#xA0;2]) Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/64/0\" data-bid=\"65-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron Valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/65/0\" data-bid=\"66-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/66/0\" data-bid=\"67-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 12:31-40</a>.<strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps. </em></strong>This gate is also known as the Gate of the Potsherds and is usually called the Dung Gate.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/68/0\" data-bid=\"69-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:13,&#xA0;14</a>) <span id=\"page895\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"895\" data-before-text=\"895\"></span>It was at the SE corner of the city wall and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropoeon Valley. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/69/0\" data-bid=\"70-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/70/0\" data-bid=\"71-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 19:1-6</a>) It was also the gate through which Jeremiah led some of the older men and priests of Israel and proclaimed calamity to Jerusalem, breaking an earthenware flask to illustrate God&#x2019;s breaking of the people for their serving of other gods.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/71/0\" data-bid=\"72-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 19:1-3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/71/1\" data-bid=\"72-2\" class=\"b\"> 10,&#xA0;11</a>.The name &#x201C;Gate of the Potsherds&#x201D; may have been given because fragments of pottery were thrown near there as refuse, or because fragments of pottery were ground there, the dust from which was used to make cement for plastering cisterns (as has been done in more recent times near a pool at the SW corner of the city). Also, there may have been a potter&#x2019;s industry <span id=\"page896\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"896\" data-before-text=\"896\"></span>near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropoeon Valley and at the spring called En-rogel. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/72/0\" data-bid=\"73-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 18:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/72/1\" data-bid=\"73-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:1,&#xA0;2</a>.) &#x201C;The potter&#x2019;s field&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/73/0\" data-bid=\"74-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 27:7,&#xA0;8</a>) has, since the fourth century C.E., been traditionally considered to be located on the S side of the Valley of Hinnom.<strong><em>Fountain Gate. </em></strong>This gate was so called because of its giving access to a spring or fountain nearby, perhaps En-rogel, which was below the junction of the Kidron Valley and the Valley of Hinnom. Probably the gate was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of &#x201C;the City of David&#x201D;). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/74/0\" data-bid=\"75-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/74/1\" data-bid=\"75-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/74/2\" data-bid=\"75-3\" class=\"b\"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropoeon Valley and the SW hill of the city.<strong><em>Water Gate. </em></strong>The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity or at least its access to the spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the temple area. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/75/0\" data-bid=\"76-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/76/0\" data-bid=\"77-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 12:37-40</a>) There was a public square before this gate where all the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Law and where they afterward built booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/77/0\" data-bid=\"78-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 8:1-3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/77/1\" data-bid=\"78-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;16</a>.<strong><em>Horse Gate. </em></strong>Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/78/0\" data-bid=\"79-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah&#x2019;s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the temple by the soldiers, &#x201C;she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king&#x2019;s house.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/79/0\" data-bid=\"80-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 23:15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/79/1\" data-bid=\"80-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located SE of the temple area. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/80/0\" data-bid=\"81-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:28;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/80/1\" data-bid=\"81-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/81/0\" data-bid=\"82-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 12:37-40</a>.<strong><em>Inspection Gate. </em></strong>Some call the Inspection (Heb., <em>ham&#xB7;miph&#xB7;qadh&#x2B9;</em>) Gate the Muster Gate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/82/0\" data-bid=\"83-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:31</a>, <em>RS; Ro</em>) At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/83/0\" data-bid=\"84-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 43:21</a> <em>miph&#xB7;qadh&#x2B9; </em>(the same Hebrew word without the article <em>ha</em>) is translated &#x201C;appointed place.&#x201D; Some have thought it was the same as the Gate of the Guard. Its mention by Nehemiah in his reconstruction account would seem to support the idea that it was a gate in the E wall of the city in front of the temple area and N of the Horse Gate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/84/0\" data-bid=\"85-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:27-31</a>) Nehemiah&#x2019;s statement that there was a corner in the wall beyond the Inspection Gate would place this gate in the E wall, S of where the wall turned (likely in a northwestward direction).The account tells us that the repair work was done &#x201C;in front of the Inspection Gate.&#x201D; Some have understood this to refer to a repair work on the city wall in front of a temple gate by this name. This does not seem to be the correct view, for the same expression is used respecting the Water Gate, which is acknowledged to have been a gate <em>in </em>the city wall. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/85/0\" data-bid=\"86-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:26,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/85/1\" data-bid=\"86-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;31</a>) The Inspection Gate is not named in the procession account evidently because the marchers did not traverse the wall E of the temple.<strong><em>Gate of the Guard. </em></strong>From this gate (called &#x201C;prison gate,&#x201D; <em>KJ</em>) part of the inauguration procession left the wall and proceeded to the temple.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/86/0\" data-bid=\"87-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 12:39,&#xA0;40</a>.<strong><em>Middle Gate. </em></strong>When the wall of Jerusalem was breached by the Babylonians, their military officers sat in the Middle Gate. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/87/0\" data-bid=\"88-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 39:3</a>) Most likely this was identical with the Gate of the Old City, since this gate, at the convergence of the Broad Wall, the N wall of the old city, and the W wall of the second quarter, was a central or commanding position. However, opinions differ, and some favor the Gate of Ephraim or the Fish Gate.<strong><em>Gate of Benjamin. </em></strong>Some identify the Gate of Benjamin with the Sheep Gate. This location would fit the circumstances of Jeremiah&#x2019;s attempted exit to the territory of Benjamin, evidently toward Anathoth, which lay NE of Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/88/0\" data-bid=\"89-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 37:11-13</a>) Zedekiah was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin when approached by Ebed-melech with a plea in Jeremiah&#x2019;s behalf. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/89/0\" data-bid=\"90-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 38:7,&#xA0;8</a>) <span id=\"page897\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"897\" data-before-text=\"897\"></span>It is reasonable that the king would be near the point of greatest concern during the Babylonian siege. The Sheep Gate on the N of the city would be the most seriously threatened by the attacking Babylonians. However, some believe that the Gate of Benjamin was the Inspection Gate.<strong><em>Other gates mentioned. </em></strong>When King Zedekiah fled from the Babylonians, he went out &#x201C;by the way of the gate between the double wall that is by the king&#x2019;s garden.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/90/0\" data-bid=\"91-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 52:7,&#xA0;8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/90/1\" data-bid=\"91-2\" class=\"b\"> 39:4</a>) There is much uncertainty as to the identity of &#x201C;the double wall.&#x201D; However, from present knowledge, either the Gate of the Ash-heaps or the Fountain Gate might fit the circumstances described in the Scriptures, both of these being near the king&#x2019;s garden.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/91/0\" data-bid=\"92-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 25:4,&#xA0;5</a>.At <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/92/0\" data-bid=\"93-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Kings 23:8</a> reference is made to &#x201C;the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the chief of the city, which was at the left as a person came into the gate of the city.&#x201D; Here &#x201C;gate of Joshua&#x201D; is not the name of a city gate but evidently is a gate within the city walls leading to the governor&#x2019;s residence, which was at the left as a person entered the city gate.<strong>Temple Gates. </strong><em>East Gate. </em>Nehemiah&#x2019;s reconstruction account tells us that the keeper of the East Gate shared in the repair work. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/93/0\" data-bid=\"94-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:29</a>) Thus the East Gate is not designated as a gate in Jerusalem&#x2019;s wall, as some have thought. The East Gate may have been approximately in line with the Inspection Gate in the city wall. This gate is evidently the one mentioned in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/94/0\" data-bid=\"95-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 9:18</a> as &#x201C;the king&#x2019;s gate to the east,&#x201D; being the gate where the king went into or came out from the temple.<em>Gate of the Foundation. </em>A temple gate, the location of which is uncertain.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/95/0\" data-bid=\"96-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 11:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/95/1\" data-bid=\"96-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 23:5</a>.<em>&#x201C;Upper gate of the house of Jehovah.&#x201D; </em>This may have been a gate leading to the inner court, possibly &#x201C;the new gate of Jehovah,&#x201D; where Jeremiah was tried; also where Jeremiah&#x2019;s secretary Baruch read the scroll before the people.

These were: the two Huldah Gates on the S, the Kiponus Gate on the W, the Tadi (Todi) Gate on the N, and the Eastern Gate, on which was portrayed the Palace of Shushan. Josephus, on the other hand, refers to four gates on the W. (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>XV, 410 [xi,&#xA0;5]) These four gates have now been identified by archaeological investigation.
