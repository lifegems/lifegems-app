Artificial pools were dug out of the soil or hewn out of rock. At times they were located inside the cities and linked to springs by means of conduits. This ensured the inhabitants a supply of water even in time of siege. Some pools were enlargements or adaptations of such existing natural features as caves.Among the various pools mentioned in the Scriptures are those of Gibeon (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 2:13</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/0\">GIBEON, GIBEONITES</a>), Hebron (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 4:12</a>), Heshbon (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ca 7:4</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/1\">BATH-RABBIM</a>), Samaria (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 22:38</a>), and Jerusalem. It has been suggested that the pools made by the congregator (King Solomon) for irrigation purposes are perhaps to be identified with reservoirs found S of Bethlehem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 2:6</a>) Water from nearby springs was stored in these reservoirs.<strong>Pools of Jerusalem. </strong>The general location of the ancient Pool of Siloam (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 9:7</a>) is thought to be the present Birket Silwan, just SW of the City of David. Likely this is also the approximate location of King Hezekiah&#x2019;s pool adjoining the conduit that he constructed to bring the waters of the spring of Gihon into Jerusalem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 20:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 32:30</a>.The Biblical references to the &#x201C;old pool&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 22:11</a>), &#x201C;upper pool&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 18:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 7:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> 36:2</a>), and &#x201C;lower pool&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 22:9</a>) give no indication about their exact position in relation to the city of Jerusalem. Scholars generally believe that the &#x201C;lower pool&#x201D; (perhaps the same as &#x201C;the Pool of the Canal&#x201D; mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003522/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 3:15</a>) may be identified with Birket el-Hamra at the southern end of the Tyropoeon Valley.
