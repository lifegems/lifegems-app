On the third creative &#x201C;day,&#x201D; God caused the earth to bring forth &#x201C;vegetation bearing seed according to its kind&#x201D;; thus it was able to reproduce.

To supply needed moisture for coming plant life, Jehovah provided that mist should regularly rise from the earth to water the ground. It kept vegetation flourishing earth wide, even though there was then no rain.
