It commonly occurs in compound place-names.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000605/0\">BEER-ELIM</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000605/1\">BEER-SHEBA</a>.<strong>1. </strong>After passing the Arnon on their approach to the Promised Land, the Israelites came to Beer. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000605/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 21:13-16</a>) Here a well was dug, apparently by the princely heads of the tribes, using their own staffs, and water sprang up. This event was cause for the poetic song set forth in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000605/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">verses 17, 18</a>.Due to the part played by the princes in the digging of the well, some suggest that this is the same place as Beer-elim (meaning &#x201C;Well of the Big Trees&#x201D;). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000605/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 15:8</a>) The location is uncertain, but it is considered likely to have been in the torrent valley called the Wadi Thamad, N of the Arnon and some 56&#xA0;km (35&#xA0;mi) E of the Dead Sea. Water is often found here quite easily by scooping out the soil.<strong>2. </strong>A place to which Jotham, Gideon&#x2019;s (Jerubbaal&#x2019;s) son, fled after exposing Abimelech&#x2019;s treachery.

(See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000605/2\">BEEROTH</a>.) In view of the absence of any indication of the direction of Jotham&#x2019;s flight from Mount Gerizim, however, the identification is uncertain."}
