Her mother&#x2019;s name was Cypros. Before she was six years old, her marriage to prince Epiphanes of Commagene was arranged, but it never materialized because of the refusal of the groom-to-be to embrace Judaism. A Syrian king, Azizus of Emesa, met the terms of circumcision, and Drusilla became his bride at the age of&#xA0;14. Aggravated by his cruelty and nettled by the envy of her less attractive sister Bernice, Drusilla was easily induced to divorce Azizus, contrary to <span id=\"page658\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"658\" data-before-text=\"658\"></span>Jewish law, and marry Governor Felix about 54&#xA0;C.E. Perhaps she was present when prisoner Paul &#x201C;talked about righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come,&#x201D; which proved to be most disquieting subjects for Governor Felix. After two years, when Felix turned the governorship over to Festus, he left Paul in chains &#x201C;to gain favor with the Jews,&#x201D; which some think was done to please his youthful wife &#x201C;who was a Jewess.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001227/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 24:24-27</a>) Drusilla&#x2019;s son by Felix was another Agrippa, reportedly killed in the great eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79&#xA0;C.E."}
