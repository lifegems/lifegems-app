Since the harvest of olives came after that of grapes, the same presses were often used for extracting both grape juice and olive oil, although there was also a pillar type of press used for olives.Common presses usually consisted of two shallow sinklike cavities cut out of natural limestone, the one on a higher level connected by a small channel to the lower one. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 18:27,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ki 6:27</a>) The grapes or olives were trodden or crushed in the upper basin (<em>gath, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 13:15</a>), allowing the juices to flow by gravity into the lower vat (<em>ye&#x2B9;qev, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 7:25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 3:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Joe 2:24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> Hag 2:16</a>). In <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joel 3:13</a> both terms occur: &#x201C;Come, descend, for the winepress [<em>gath</em>] has become full. The press vats [<em>ha&#xB7;yeqa&#xB7;vim&#x2B9;, </em>plural of <em>ye&#x2B9;qev</em>] actually overflow.&#x201D; Apparently the term <em>ye&#x2B9;qev </em>was also used in reference to single-basin presses, in which both the treading of the grapes and the collecting of the <span id=\"page680\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"680\" data-before-text=\"680\"></span>juice took place. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Job 24:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 5:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 16:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> Jer 48:33</a>) The bottoms of these presses were more on an incline than the conventional two-basin type, to allow for the collecting of the juice at the lower end. If the press was long and narrow, like a trough, it was called <em>pu&#xB7;rah&#x2B9;. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 63:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> Hag 2:16</a>) The Christian Greek Scriptures also speak of the winepress (<em>le&#xB7;nos&#x2B9;, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 21:33</a>), as well as the &#x201C;vat for the winepress&#x201D; (<em>hy&#xB7;po&#xB7;le&#x2B9;ni&#xB7;on, </em><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 12:1</a>).One such winepress was found, the upper basin of which measured 2.4&#xA0;m (8&#xA0;ft) square and 38&#xA0;cm (15&#xA0;in.) deep. The smaller vat, some 0.6&#xA0;m (2&#xA0;ft) lower in elevation, into which the juice ran, was 1.2&#xA0;m (4&#xA0;ft) square and 0.9&#xA0;m (3&#xA0;ft) deep. Such a winepress served Gideon as a place in which to thresh his wheat.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 6:11</a>.Crushing the fruit in these presses was usually done by bare feet or by heavy stones. From two to seven or more treaders worked as a team in the press. It was therefore noteworthy that Isaiah said the Great Treader, Jehovah, will tread the wine trough <em>alone. </em>(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 63:3</a>) Above the heads of the treaders was a crossbeam from which ropes extended for the men to hold on to for support. The splashing of &#x201C;the blood of grapes&#x201D; stained the upper garments of the treaders. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 49:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 63:2</a>) Although it meant plenty of hard work, the crushing season was usually a time of rejoicing; joyful shouting and singing helped to keep rhythm in the treading.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 63:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/13/1\" data-bid=\"14-2\" class=\"b\"> La 1:15</a>) In the day of Jehovah when crowds are assembled in the low plain of decision, the command goes forth: &#x201C;Thrust in a sickle, for harvest has grown ripe. Come, descend, for the winepress has become full. The press vats actually overflow; for their badness has become abundant.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Joe 3:13,&#xA0;14</a>) Similarly, John saw in vision &#x201C;the vine of the earth&#x201D; hurled &#x201C;into the great winepress of the anger of God,&#x201D; there trodden until the &#x201C;blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses.&#x201D; The one called &#x201C;Faithful and True,&#x201D; &#x201C;The Word of God,&#x201D; is the one who treads this winepress of the &#x201C;anger of the wrath of God the Almighty.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Re 14:19, 20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003550/15/1\" data-bid=\"16-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:11-16</a>."}
