When Joseph&#x2019;s brothers had sold him into Egypt and presented Joseph&#x2019;s blood-soaked garment to make it appear that he had been killed by a wild beast, Jacob sat in judgment, examined the evidence, and made a judicial decision: &#x201C;Joseph is surely torn to pieces!&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 37:33</a>) Judah sat in judgment when he found that Tamar was pregnant, sentencing her to be put to death.

At first he was trying to handle all the cases, which were so numerous that he was busy from morning to evening. On the counsel of Jethro he appointed capable men as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 18:13-26</a>) It does not appear that this meant that there was one specially appointed judge for every seven or eight able-bodied males. Rather, the nation was organized with chiefs authorized to handle smaller cases whenever necessary. But anything unusually complicated or difficult, or a matter of national importance, was to be brought to Moses or to the sanctuary before the priests.These hard matters for judgment included the following: Where the husband was suspicious of the chastity of his wife (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 5:11-31</a>), a case of bloodshed where there was a dispute (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">De 17:8,&#xA0;9</a>), and certain cases where revolt was charged against a man but where the evidence was unclear or suspicious (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">De 19:15-20</a>).

Also, the publicity that would be afforded any trial at the gate would tend to influence the judges toward care and justice in the trial proceedings and in their decisions.

It did not sit in judgment on the Sabbath or on feast days. In capital cases the Sanhedrin held trial during the daytime, and the verdict had to be reached during the daytime. If it was a verdict of conviction, it had to be issued on the following day. Therefore, trials could not be held on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a festival day. However, this procedure was ignored in the case of Jesus&#x2019; trial.The Mishnah (<em>Sanhedrin </em>4:3) states: &#x201C;The Sanhedrin was arranged like the half of a round threshing-floor so that they all might see one another. Before them stood the two scribes of the <span id=\"page519\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"519\" data-before-text=\"519\"></span>judges, one to the right and one to the left, and they wrote down the words of them that favoured acquittal and the words of them that favoured conviction.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Translated by H.&#xA0;Danby.According to Jewish tradition the Sanhedrin was set up by Moses (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 11:16-25</a>) and reorganized by Ezra immediately after the return from the exile. But there is no historical evidence to support the idea that 70 older men sat as a single court to hear cases in those early times. Rather, the Sanhedrin seems to have come into existence during the time of Greek rule in Palestine. In the time of Jesus&#x2019; earthly ministry the Roman government allowed the Sanhedrin a great measure of independence, granting it civil and administrative authority. It had officers at its disposal as well as the power of arrest and imprisonment. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:47;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/55/1\" data-bid=\"56-2\" class=\"b\"> Ac 4:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/55/2\" data-bid=\"56-3\" class=\"b\"> 9:1,&#xA0;2</a>) Its religious authority was recognized even among the Jews of the Dispersion. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 9:1,&#xA0;2</a>.) However, under the Roman rule the Sanhedrin in time evidently lost the legal authority to execute the death penalty, unless they got the permission of the Roman governor (procurator). (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 18:31</a>) After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70&#xA0;C.E., the Sanhedrin was abolished.In Jerusalem there were, in addition, lower courts composed of 23 members each. According to the Mishnah (<em>Sanhedrin </em>1:6), these smaller courts were also located in other cities of sufficient size throughout Palestine. The full number of judges comprising the court did not sit on every case. The number varied according to the seriousness of the matter to be judged and the difficulty in reaching a verdict. Additionally, there was the village court consisting of three men, and a court consisting of seven older men of the village.The synagogues, which were used primarily for education, were also used to some extent as places for local courts, at times referred to as &#x2018;local Sanhedrins,&#x2019; having the power to inflict the penalties of scourging and excommunication.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:17</a>, ftn; <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">23:34;</a> <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 13:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/60/1\" data-bid=\"61-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 21:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/60/2\" data-bid=\"61-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 9:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/60/3\" data-bid=\"61-4\" class=\"b\"> 12:42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/60/4\" data-bid=\"61-5\" class=\"b\"> 16:2</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/0\">ILLUSTRATIONS</a> (Some of Jesus&#x2019; prominent illustrations [21]).<strong>The Christian Congregation. </strong>The Christian congregation, while having no secular authority as a court, may take action against disorderly members who require spiritual discipline, and it can even expel them from the congregation. Therefore, the apostle Paul tells the congregation that they, that is, the representative members thereof, those having oversight, must judge those inside the organization. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 5:12,&#xA0;13</a>) In writing to congregations and to overseers both Paul and Peter point out that the elders should keep a close watch on the congregation&#x2019;s spiritual condition and should assist and admonish anyone who is taking an unwise or wrong step. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 4:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/62/1\" data-bid=\"63-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 5:1,&#xA0;2</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/63/0\" data-bid=\"64-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 6:1</a>.) Those who are causing divisions or sects are to be warned a first and a second time before congregational action is taken.

If these efforts failed and the issue was of a serious nature, they should take it to the congregation for settlement (that is, to those appointed to responsible positions in governing the congregation). Paul later admonished Christians to settle difficulties in this manner and not to be taking one another before worldly courts.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/68/0\" data-bid=\"69-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 18:15-17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/68/1\" data-bid=\"69-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 6:1-8</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001051/1\">LEGAL CASE</a>."}
