It appears that concubines were slave girls, one of three kinds: (1)&#xA0;a Hebrew girl sold by her father (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:7-9</a>), (2)&#xA0;a foreign slave girl purchased, or (3)&#xA0;a foreign girl captured in warfare (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">De 21:10-14</a>). Some were the slave girls or handmaids of the free wife, as in the cases of Sarah, Leah, and Rachel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 16:3,&#xA0;4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 30:3-13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> Jg 8:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/2/3\" data-bid=\"3-4\" class=\"b\"> 9:18</a>.Concubinage was in existence before the Law covenant and was recognized and regulated by the Law, which protected the rights of both wives and concubines.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 16:21,&#xA0;22</a>) After King Solomon was enthroned, Adonijah, an older brother of Solomon, who had already made an attempt for the kingship, approached Solomon&#x2019;s mother, Bath-sheba, saying: &#x201C;You yourself well know that the kingship was to have become mine,&#x201D; and then asked her to request of Solomon, Abishag the Shunammite, who appears to have been viewed as a wife or a concubine of David. Solomon angrily answered: &#x201C;Request also for him the kingship,&#x201D; and then he ordered that Adonijah be put to death, indicating that he construed Adonijah&#x2019;s request as an effort to get the kingdom.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 1:5-7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:13-25</a>.God did not see fit to restore the original standard of monogamy as he had established it in the <span id=\"page496\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"496\" data-before-text=\"496\"></span>garden of Eden until the appearance of Jesus Christ, but he did protect the concubine by legislation. Concubinage logically worked toward a more rapid increase of the population in Israel.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 19:5,&#xA0;6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/10/1\" data-bid=\"11-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 7:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/10/2\" data-bid=\"11-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Ti 3:2</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/0\">MARRIAGE</a> (Polygamy).<strong>Figurative Use. </strong>The apostle Paul likens Jehovah to the husband of a free wife, the &#x201C;Jerusalem above,&#x201D; who is the &#x201C;mother&#x201D; of spirit-begotten Christians, as Abraham was husband to Sarah. He compares the relationship of Jehovah to the nation of Israel represented by its capital city Jerusalem to that of a husband and a concubine. Through the Law covenant Jehovah was &#x2018;married&#x2019; to Jerusalem as a &#x201C;servant girl,&#x201D; a &#x2018;concubine,&#x2019; analogous to the relationship of Abraham to the slave girl and concubine Hagar.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 4:22-29</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001020/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 54:1-6</a>."}
