Since these seven court officials were attendants of the king and apparently not assigned as guardians of the women (as was Hegai, the king&#x2019;s eunuch mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000008/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Esther 2:3</a>), they may not have been eunuchs in the physical sense."}
