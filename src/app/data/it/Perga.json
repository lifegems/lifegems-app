The ruins of ancient Perga are believed to be near the modern village of Murtana, about 13&#xA0;km (8&#xA0;mi) inland from the S coast of Asia Minor and some 8&#xA0;km (5&#xA0;mi) W of the Cestrus (Aksu) River. It appears that anciently, according to the Greek geographer Strabo, this river was navigable as far N as Perga. (<em>Geography, </em>14, IV,&#xA0;2) However, nearby Attalia on the coast of Pamphylia seems to have served as Perga&#x2019;s harbor and, in time, even displaced Perga in importance.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003442/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 14:24-26</a>.It was to this city that the apostle Paul and his associates came early in the course of his first missionary journey.
