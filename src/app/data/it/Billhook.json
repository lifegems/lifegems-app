(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000739/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 10:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000739/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Isa 44:12</a>) The root from which this Hebrew term is considered to be drawn has been linked with words in related languages meaning &#x201C;reap,&#x201D; &#x201C;cut off.&#x201D; Consequently Koehler and Baumgartner define <em>ma&#xB7;&#x2BD;atsadh&#x2B9; </em>as &#x201C;billhook.&#x201D; (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;550) The modern billhook consists of a handle and a blade with a hook-shaped point. However, others understand <em>ma&#xB7;&#x2BD;atsadh&#x2B9; </em>to designate a kind of ax, since this is its meaning in late Hebrew, and suggest that it may refer to an adz."}
