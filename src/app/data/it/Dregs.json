In the Scriptures the term <span id=\"page652\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"652\" data-before-text=\"652\"></span>occurs five times, always in the plural (Heb., <em>shema&#xB7;rim&#x2B9;</em>). It is generally rendered &#x201C;lees&#x201D; by Bible translators. Keeping a good wine &#x201C;on the dregs&#x201D; for a long time to age fully gives it clarity, strength, and mellowness. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001223/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 25:6</a>) On the other hand, when a wine that is bad to start with because of a poor quality of grape is left to congeal on the dregs, it does not improve in taste or smell, facts to which the prophets refer in illustrations. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001223/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 48:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001223/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Zep 1:12</a>) Also, in a figure of speech the psalmist says that &#x201C;all the wicked ones of the earth&#x201D; will be compelled to drain the cup of Jehovah&#x2019;s anger, drinking the dregs and all, down to the last bitter drop.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001223/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 75:8</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001223/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 23:32-34</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001223/0\">WINE AND STRONG DRINK</a>."}
