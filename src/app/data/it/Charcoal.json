In ancient times it was made by covering a pile of wood with earth and burning it slowly for several days with only a sufficient amount of air to burn off the gases. This practice left behind a relatively pure form of carbon. It was a time-consuming process requiring careful supervision, but charcoal was a favored fuel when intense, sustained heat without smoke was desired. There is no evidence that natural mineral coal was used in ancient Israel.Charcoal, in an open fire or in a brazier, was used to warm oneself in cold weather. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000922/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 47:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000922/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 36:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000922/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Joh 18:18</a>) Its even heat with an absence of flame and smoke also highly recommended it for cooking. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000922/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 21:9</a>) For smelting and refining metals, charcoal was indispensable; without it, reaching and sustaining the great temperatures required to reduce the ores to pure metals was hardly possible. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000922/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 44:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000922/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 54:16</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000922/0\">REFINE, REFINER</a>.) Much the same as is done today in charging an iron blast furnace, the ore was sandwiched in between layers of charcoal. This practice apparently gave rise to the proverb: Kindness toward an enemy is like coals of fire upon his head; it softens his anger and brings out the good in him.
