Common use often distinguishes between <em>abortion </em>and <em>miscarriage, </em>the former being defined as the deliberate and induced emptying of a pregnant uterus, the latter being considered as the accidental and unavoidable interruption of pregnancy. The distinction between abortion and miscarriage is not made in the Bible; there the terms are used in a broader and interchangeable sense. The Hebrew <em>sha&#xB7;khal&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;suffer an abortion&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 23:26</a>), is also rendered &#x201C;bereave&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">De 32:25</a>), &#x2018;bereave of children&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Le 26:22</a>), &#x2018;miscarry&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ho 9:14</a>), and &#x201C;prove fruitless&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mal 3:11</a>). The Hebrew word <em>yoh&#xB7;tse&#x2BC;th&#x2B9;, </em>rendered &#x201C;abortion&#x201D; in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 144:14</a>, is from a root meaning &#x201C;come out.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 27:30</a>.) The expressions &#x201C;miscarriage&#x201D; and &#x201C;one prematurely born&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 58:8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> Ec 6:3</a>) render the Hebrew word <em>ne&#x2B9;phel, </em>which comes from the root <em>na&#xB7;phal&#x2B9;, </em>meaning &#x201C;fall.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 26:18</a>.Unavoidable abortion or miscarriage may be caused by accident, infectious disease, mental or physical stress and strain, or because of a general organic weakness on the part of the mother. The waters near Jericho were death dealing, causing miscarriages, until Jehovah&#x2019;s prophet Elisha healed them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 2:19-22</a>.Deliberately to induce abortion or miscarriage by artificial means, by the use of drugs, or by medical operation, the sole purpose of which is to avoid the birth of an unwanted child, is an act of high crime in the sight of God. Life as a precious gift from God is sacred. Hence God&#x2019;s law to Moses protected the life of an unborn baby against more than criminal abortion, for if in a fracas between men a pregnant woman suffered an accident fatal to her or the child, &#x201C;then you must give soul for soul.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:22-25</a>) Of course, before applying that penalty, the circumstances and degree of deliberateness were taken into consideration by the judges. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 35:22-24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;31</a>.) But emphasizing the seriousness of any deliberate attempt to cause injury, Dr.&#xA0;J. Glenn comments: &#x201C;The viable embryo in the uterus <em>IS </em>a human individual, and therefore destroying it, is a violation of the sixth commandment.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>The Bible and Modern Medicine, </em>1963, p.&#xA0;176.Properly viewed, the fruitage of the womb is a blessing of Jehovah.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Job 3:11-16</a>) Solomon, too, reasoned that a prematurely expelled fetus is better off than the person who lives a long time but who never comes to enjoy life.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Ec 6:3</a>.Contagious abortion, a disease characterized by premature birth, may occur among animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Accidental abortion due to neglect or disease of domestic animals has also been known since the days of the patriarchs Jacob and Job.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 31:38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000059/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> Job 21:10</a>."}
