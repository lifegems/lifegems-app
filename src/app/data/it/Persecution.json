This great Prophet had foretold this when, three days before his impalement, he declared to unfaithful Jerusalem: &#x201C;I am sending forth to you prophets and wise men and public instructors. Some of them you will kill and impale, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city; that there may come upon you all the righteous blood spilled on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 23:34,&#xA0;35</a>.Privately, Jesus had also repeatedly warned his disciples, saying, &#x201C;You will be objects of hatred by all people on account of my name .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.

If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also.&#x201D; &#x201C;Men will expel you from the synagogue. In fact, the hour is coming when everyone that kills you will imagine he has rendered a sacred service to God.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:22, 23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\"> Joh 15:20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/37/2\" data-bid=\"38-3\" class=\"b\"> 16:2</a>.Soon after Pentecost 33&#xA0;C.E., there were arrests, threats, and beatings.

The murder of Stephen was followed by a great siege of persecution led in part by Saul of Tarsus, the results of which scattered the Jerusalem congregation far and wide, but thereby extended the activity of preaching the good news.

The charges varied, but the objectives always seemed to be the same, namely, the suppression of Christianity.<strong>Proper Attitude Toward Persecution. </strong>If one keeps God&#x2019;s commandments as a Christian, it is impossible to escape persecution, for &#x201C;all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 3:12</a>) Yet true Christians are able to endure all manner of wicked persecution and still maintain a happy attitude free of malice and hatred of the persecutors. This is because they understand the issues involved<wbr>&#x2014;the source of the persecution and why it is permitted. Instead of being puzzled and worried over such experiences, they rejoice to share with Christ in the test of loyalty under persecution.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 4:12-14</a>.The Christian, however, must be certain that what he suffers is really for a righteous cause. The Bible account and pattern allow for no mixing in politics, plotting of conspiracies, nor any type of criminal activities as the basis for one&#x2019;s being persecuted. Giving particular stress to this, the apostle urges: &#x201C;Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, that, in the thing in which they are speaking against you as evildoers, they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for his inspection.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 2:11,&#xA0;12</a>) He followed this up with counsel as to subjection to government officials, to slave owners, to husbands, citing the example of Christ Jesus as the model to be followed. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 2:13-25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/48/1\" data-bid=\"49-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:1-6</a>) A Christian could be happy if suffering for the sake of righteousness (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:13,&#xA0;14</a>) but should never suffer &#x201C;as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a busybody in other people&#x2019;s matters.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 4:15,&#xA0;16</a>.Christians also appreciate the prize awaiting those who endure. Concerning this reward, Jesus declared: &#x201C;Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness&#x2019; sake, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:10</a>) Knowledge of the resurrection hope coupled with knowledge of the One who is the Source of that provision strengthens them. It fortifies them to be loyal to God even if threatened by death at the hands of violent persecutors. As a result of their faith in what Jesus&#x2019; death accomplished, they have been emancipated from the fear of such a violent death. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 2:14,&#xA0;15</a>) The Christian&#x2019;s mental attitude is <span id=\"page611\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"611\" data-before-text=\"611\"></span>important if he is to maintain faithfulness under the pressure of opposition. &#x201C;Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Php 2:5-8</a>) &#x201C;For the joy that was set before [Jesus] he endured a torture stake, despising shame.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 12:2</a>; see also <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/55/0\" data-bid=\"56-1\" class=\"b\">2Co 12:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/55/1\" data-bid=\"56-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Th 1:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/55/2\" data-bid=\"56-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 2:21-23</a>.The Christian&#x2019;s attitude toward the persecutors themselves is also an important factor. Loving one&#x2019;s enemies and blessing those opposed enables a person to endure. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:44;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/56/1\" data-bid=\"57-2\" class=\"b\"> Ro 12:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/56/2\" data-bid=\"57-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 4:12,&#xA0;13</a>) This too the Christian knows: Anyone forsaking home and relatives for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven is promised a hundredfold more, but &#x201C;with persecutions&#x201D; also. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 10:29,&#xA0;30</a>) It is true that not everyone who hears the good news of the Kingdom will endure the heat of persecution, and some may attempt to sidestep the issues to avoid trouble. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 13:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/58/1\" data-bid=\"59-2\" class=\"b\"> Ga 6:12</a>) But it is better to rely on Jehovah&#x2019;s strength, praying as David did for deliverance from the persecutors, knowing he will not leave his servants in the lurch. Then one will be able to say with the apostle: &#x201C;We are coming off completely victorious through him that loved us.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 7:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/59/1\" data-bid=\"60-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Co 4:9, 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003446/59/2\" data-bid=\"60-3\" class=\"b\"> Ro 8:35-37</a>."}
