Envious persons want what others have and may feel that those possessing what is coveted are not entitled to it. While the Hebrew word <em>qin&#xB7;&#x2BC;ah&#x2B9;, </em>depending on the context, may refer to zeal, ardor, insistence on exclusive devotion, or jealousy and envying (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001377/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 19:31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001377/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ps 79:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001377/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Nu 25:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001377/0/3\" data-bid=\"1-4\" class=\"b\"> 5:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001377/0/4\" data-bid=\"1-5\" class=\"b\"> Job 5:2</a>), the Greek <em>phtho&#x2B9;nos </em>consistently has a negative connotation and denotes envy.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001377/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 1:29</a>.One of the bad inclinations of sinful man is the tendency to envy. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001377/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 4:5</a>) It is an expression of hatred. Because the Philistines envied Isaac&#x2019;s prosperity, they maliciously stopped up the wells upon which he depended for watering his flocks and herds. Finally, their king requested that Isaac leave the area.

The first concern of the person teaching them is, not the glory of God, but the promotion of his own doctrine. The resulting envy may find expression in efforts to misrepresent and malign true Christians, undermining their labors and wholesome influence.

Their intent was to discredit Paul&#x2019;s reputation and apostolic authority, of which they were envious. They tried to discourage and dishearten the imprisoned apostle.

Even the death of wicked ones may be peaceful, not accompanied by great anguish. When a servant of God looks at his possibly less favorable circumstances, he may allow envy of the circumstances of wicked ones to erode his appreciation of the value of doing the divine will, as did the psalmist Asaph.

While struggling to raise himself to the level of those he envies, he degrades himself morally, sacrificing right principles. Even if he succeeds in acquiring riches, these are but temporary and must be left behind at death. Thus he has struggled or &#x2018;bestirred himself&#x2019; for nothing.
