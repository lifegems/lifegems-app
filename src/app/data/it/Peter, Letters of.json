(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Pe 1:1</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 3:1</a>.) Additional internal evidence unmistakably points to Peter as the writer. He speaks of himself as an eyewitness of the transfiguration of Jesus Christ, a privilege shared only by Peter, James, and John. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 1:16-18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 17:1-9</a>) And, as is evident from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">John 21:18, 19</a>, Peter alone could have said: &#x201C;The putting off of my tabernacle is soon to be, just as also our Lord Jesus Christ signified to me.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 1:14</a>) The difference in style between the two letters may be attributed to the fact that Peter used Silvanus (Silas) for writing the first letter but apparently did not do so when writing his second letter. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 5:12</a>) Both were general letters, evidently directed to Jewish and non-Jewish Christians. The first letter is specifically addressed to those in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia<wbr>&#x2014;regions of Asia Minor.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/6/2\" data-bid=\"7-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Pe 1:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/6/3\" data-bid=\"7-4\" class=\"b\"> 3:1</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 9,&#xA0;10</a>.The letters of Peter agree fully with other Bible books in stressing right conduct and its rewards and also in quoting from them as the authoritative Word of God.

Scriptural prophecy is shown to be the product of God&#x2019;s spirit.

God&#x2019;s promise concerning new heavens and a new earth is repeated.

Noteworthy, too, is the fact that the letters of the apostle Paul are classified by Peter with &#x201C;the rest of the Scriptures.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">2Pe 3:15,&#xA0;16</a>.<strong>Time of Writing. </strong>From the tone of the letters, it appears that they were written prior to the outbreak of Nero&#x2019;s persecution in 64&#xA0;C.E. The fact that Mark was with Peter would seem to place the time of composition of the first letter between 62 and 64&#xA0;C.E. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 5:13</a>) Earlier, during the apostle Paul&#x2019;s first imprisonment at Rome (c.&#xA0;59-61&#xA0;C.E.), Mark was there, and when Paul was imprisoned for a second time at Rome (c.&#xA0;65&#xA0;C.E.), he requested that Timothy and Mark join him. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Col 4:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ti 4:11</a>) Likely Peter wrote his second letter not long after his first, or about 64&#xA0;C.E.<strong>Written From Babylon. </strong>According to Peter&#x2019;s own testimony, he composed his first letter while at Babylon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 5:13</a>) Possibly also from there he wrote his second letter. Available evidence clearly shows that &#x201C;Babylon&#x201D; refers to the city on the Euphrates and not to Rome, as some have claimed. Having been entrusted with &#x2018;the good news for those who are circumcised,&#x2019; Peter could be expected to serve in a center of Judaism, such as Babylon. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Ga 2:7-9</a>) There was a large Jewish population in and around the ancient city of Babylon. The <em>Encyclopaedia Judaica </em>(Jerusalem, 1971, Vol.&#xA0;15, col. 755), when discussing production of the Babylonian Talmud, refers to Judaism&#x2019;s &#x201C;great academies of Babylon&#x201D; during the Common Era. Since Peter wrote to &#x201C;the temporary residents scattered about in [literal] Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/26/0\" data-bid=\"27-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:1</a>), it logically follows that the source of the letter, &#x201C;Babylon,&#x201D; was the literal place by that name. Never does the Bible indicate that Babylon <span id=\"page622\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"622\" data-before-text=\"622\"></span>specifically refers to Rome, nor does it state that Peter was ever in Rome.The first to claim that Peter was martyred at Rome is Dionysius, bishop of Corinth in the latter half of the second century. Earlier, Clement of Rome, though mentioning Paul and Peter together, makes Paul&#x2019;s preaching in both the E <em>and </em>the W a distinguishing feature of that apostle, implying that Peter was never in the W.&#xA0;As the vicious persecution of Christians by the Roman government (under Nero) had seemingly not yet begun, there would have been no reason for Peter to veil the identity of Rome by the use of another name. When Paul wrote to the Romans, sending greetings by name to many in Rome, he omitted Peter. Had Peter been a leading overseer there, this would have been an unlikely omission. Also, Peter&#x2019;s name is not included among those sending greetings in Paul&#x2019;s letters written from Rome<wbr>&#x2014;Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 2&#xA0;Timothy, Philemon, Hebrews.<strong>First Peter. </strong>The Christians to whom the apostle Peter addressed his first letter were experiencing severe trials. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:6</a>) Additionally, &#x201C;the end of all things&#x201D; had drawn close<wbr>&#x2014;evidently the end of the Jewish system of things foretold by Jesus. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/28/0\" data-bid=\"29-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 13:1-4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/28/1\" data-bid=\"29-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Th 2:14-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/28/2\" data-bid=\"29-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 9:26</a>.) It was, therefore, a time for them to be &#x201C;vigilant with a view to prayers.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 4:7</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:40-45</a>.) They also needed encouragement to endure faithfully, the very encouragement provided by the apostle.Repeatedly, Peter reminded fellow Christians of the blessings they enjoyed. Because of God&#x2019;s mercy, they had received a new birth to a living hope, giving them reason for rejoicing. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:3-9</a>) They had been bought with Christ&#x2019;s precious blood. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:18,&#xA0;19</a>) Through the baptismal arrangement, they had received a good conscience and would continue to enjoy such by living in harmony with what their water baptism symbolized. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:21&#x2013;4:6</a>) As living stones, they were being built <span id=\"page623\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"623\" data-before-text=\"623\"></span>on Christ Jesus to become a spiritual house or temple. They were &#x201C;a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 2:4-10</a>.In view of what God and his Son had done in their behalf, Christians, as Peter showed, had reason to endure sufferings and to maintain fine conduct. They were to expect sufferings, for &#x201C;even Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 3:17,&#xA0;18</a>) Sharing in the sufferings of Christ was in itself a reason for rejoicing, as it would result in being overjoyed at the revelation of Christ&#x2019;s glory. To be reproached for the name of Christ constituted an evidence that a person had God&#x2019;s spirit. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 4:12-14</a>) The trials themselves resulted in faith of tested quality, which was needed for salvation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 1:6-9</a>) Moreover, by faithfully enduring, they would continue to experience God&#x2019;s care. He would make them firm and strong.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 5:6-10</a>.However, as Peter emphasized, Christians were never to suffer because of being lawbreakers. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003452/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">1Pe 4:15-19</a>) Theirs was to be exemplary conduct, which would serve to silence ignorant talk against them.
