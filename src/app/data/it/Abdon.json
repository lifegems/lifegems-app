(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 12:13-15</a>) According to Josephus (<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>V, 273 [vii,&#xA0;15]), his rule of eight years was one of peace, and the Bible record makes no mention of wars during that period. Abdon&#x2019;s 40 sons and 30 grandsons all &#x201C;rode on seventy full-grown asses,&#x201D; a sign of considerable wealth and rank at that time. At the end of his judgeship, Abdon was buried in his native Ephraim.Some would connect Abdon with &#x201C;Bedan,&#x201D; mentioned at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Samuel 12:11</a>; however, Bedan is more likely identified with Barak, whose name appears in this text in both the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>and the Syriac <em>Peshitta.</em><strong>2. </strong>A Benjamite, firstborn son of Jeiel and evidently a brother of Ner, Saul&#x2019;s grandfather.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 8:29, 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 9:35, 36,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;39</a>.<strong>3. </strong>An official in King Josiah&#x2019;s court (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 34:20</a>), called Achbor at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Kings 22:12</a>.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/0\">ACHBOR</a> No.&#xA0;2.<strong>4. </strong>A son of Shashak of the tribe of Benjamin; a headman dwelling in Jerusalem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000016/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 8:23-28</a>.<strong>5. </strong>One of four cities in the territory of Asher given to the Levites of the family of Gershon (Gershom).

This site lies on the N side of the Wadi Qarn (Nahal Keziv) and at the foot of the hills of Galilee and hence near the N end of the Plain of Asher."}
