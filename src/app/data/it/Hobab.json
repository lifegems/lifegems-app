Although Hobab declined at first, apparently he did accompany the Israelites, for his descendants, the Kenites, took up dwelling in the Wilderness of Judah to the S of Arad and are mentioned as still living in that area in the time of Saul and David.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 10:29-32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> Jg 1:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 1Sa 15:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> 27:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/1/4\" data-bid=\"2-5\" class=\"b\"> 30:26,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/1/5\" data-bid=\"2-6\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;29</a>.The Masoretic text of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Judges 4:11</a>, however, identifies Hobab as the father-in-law of Moses. (<em>NW, Yg, Ro, Da, JP, Mo, AT</em>) So the one name, Hobab, may designate two separate individuals, namely, Moses&#x2019; father-in-law as well as his brother-in-law. That this is not out of the question is seen by the fact that more than one name is assigned to Moses&#x2019; father-in-law.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 2:16-22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 3:1</a>.On the other hand, if Hobab was indeed only the name of the son of Reuel and hence was the name of only the brother-in-law of Moses, then the reference to Hobab as being Moses&#x2019; father-in-law must mean that Hobab was viewed as the representative of his father Reuel, who was, in that case, likely then dead.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/0\">JETHRO</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002045/1\">KENITE</a>."}
