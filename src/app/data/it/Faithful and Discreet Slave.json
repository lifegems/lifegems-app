If approved at his master&#x2019;s coming (evidently from some trip), the slave would be rewarded by being placed over all the master&#x2019;s belongings.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 45-51</a>.In the parallel illustration at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 12:42-48</a>, the slave is called a steward, that is, a house manager or administrator, one placed over servants, though he is himself a servant. Such a position was often filled in ancient times by a faithful slave. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 24:2</a>; also the case of Joseph at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 39:1-6</a>.) In Jesus&#x2019; illustration the steward is first assigned only to the supervision and timely dispensation of the food supplies to the master&#x2019;s body of attendants, or servants, and later, because of his faithful and discreet handling of this ministry, his assignment is widened out to embrace supervision of all the master&#x2019;s holdings. Regarding the identification of the &#x201C;master&#x201D; (Gr., <em>ky&#x2B9;ri&#xB7;os, </em>also rendered &#x201C;lord&#x201D;), Jesus had already <span id=\"page806\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"806\" data-before-text=\"806\"></span>shown that he himself occupied such a position toward his disciples, and they addressed him as such on occasion. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 10:24, 25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 24:42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> Joh 13:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/4/4\" data-bid=\"5-5\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>) The question remains concerning the application of the figure of the faithful and discreet slave, or steward, and what his dispensing food to the domestics represents.&#x201C;Slave&#x201D; is in the singular. This, however, does not require that the &#x201C;slave&#x201D; prefigure only one particular person who would be so privileged. The Scriptures contain examples of the use of a singular noun to refer to a collective group, such as when Jehovah addressed the collective group of the Israelite nation and told them: &#x201C;You are my witnesses [<em>plural</em>], .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. even my servant [<em>singular</em>] whom I have chosen.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 43:10</a>) The &#x201C;antichrist&#x201D; is shown to be a collective group made up of individual antichrists. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Jo 2:<wbr>18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/6/1\" data-bid=\"7-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Jo 7</a>) Similarly, the &#x201C;slave&#x201D; is composite. It was to be appointed in the time of the end as a channel to give out spiritual &#x201C;food at the proper time.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:<wbr>3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 45;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/7/2\" data-bid=\"8-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 12:42</a>) In the first century, Jesus set a pattern for how spiritual food would be dispensed in the Christian congregation. Just as he had distributed literal food to the crowds through the hands of a few disciples, spiritual food was to be provided through the hands of a few. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 14:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/8/1\" data-bid=\"9-2\" class=\"b\"> Mk 6:<wbr>41;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/8/2\" data-bid=\"9-3\" class=\"b\"> Lu 9:<wbr>16</a>) Jesus trained the apostles for the role they would have after Pentecost&#xA0;33&#xA0;C.E. as a channel in dispensing spiritual food. They were later joined by other elders to serve as a governing body in order to settle issues and to direct the preaching and teaching of the Kingdom good news. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:<wbr>42;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 8:<wbr>14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/9/2\" data-bid=\"10-3\" class=\"b\"> 15:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/9/3\" data-bid=\"10-4\" class=\"b\"> 6-<wbr>29</a>) After the death of the apostles, a great apostasy set in. But in the time of the end<wbr>&#x2014;in keeping with the pattern he set in the first century of feeding many through the hands of a few<wbr>&#x2014;Jesus selected a small group of spirit-anointed men to serve as &#x201C;the faithful and discreet slave,&#x201D; to prepare and dispense spiritual food during his presence.The domestics are all those who belong to the Christian congregation, both the anointed and the &#x201C;other sheep,&#x201D; who are fed spiritual food. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 10:16</a>) This includes the individual members making up &#x201C;the faithful and discreet slave,&#x201D; since they too are recipients of the food dispensed. Those who make up the faithful slave will receive expanded responsibility if they are found faithful at the master&#x2019;s promised coming. When they receive their heavenly reward and become corulers with Christ, he will appoint them over &#x201C;all his belongings.&#x201D; Along with the rest of the 144,000, they will share Christ&#x2019;s vast heavenly authority.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:46, 47;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001485/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 12:43, 44</a>."}
