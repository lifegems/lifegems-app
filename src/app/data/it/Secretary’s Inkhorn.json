The Egyptian &#x2018;scribe kit&#x2019; was a long, narrow case made out of wood and had a compartment or slots for reed pens. On the outer face, near the top, it had at least one recess for a small cake of dried ink. The scribe could prepare to write by applying the moistened end of his pen to the ink. Inscriptions show that Syrian scribes used a similar &#x2018;scribal kit.&#x2019;"}
