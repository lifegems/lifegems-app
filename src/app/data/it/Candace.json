(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000877/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 8:27</a>) Instead of being a specific personal name, &#x201C;Candace,&#x201D; like &#x201C;Pharaoh&#x201D; and &#x201C;Caesar,&#x201D; is considered to be a title. Ancient writers, including Strabo, Pliny the Elder, and Eusebius, used this designation in referring to queens of Ethiopia. Pliny the Elder (c.&#xA0;23-79&#xA0;C.E.) wrote that &#x201C;the town [Mero&#xEB;, capital of ancient Ethiopia] possesses few buildings. They said that it is ruled by a woman, Candace, a name that has passed on through a succession of queens for many years.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Natural History, </em>VI, XXXV, 186."}
