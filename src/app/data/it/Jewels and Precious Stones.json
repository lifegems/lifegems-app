Jewels have been worn by both men and women from early Biblical days for purposes of adornment. Today the diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire are strictly considered to be precious stones, whereas other rare and beautiful stones are viewed as semiprecious. However, the Hebrew term rendered &#x201C;precious stone&#x201D; has a broader application, as is shown at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 28:12,&#xA0;13</a>. These precious stones are distinguished from other minerals chiefly because they are rare, beautiful, and durable.The first Biblical reference to any precious stone is at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 2:11, 12</a>, where Havilah is identified as a land containing good gold, &#x201C;bdellium gum and the onyx stone.&#x201D;Wealth was partially measured by one&#x2019;s possession of precious stones; such kings as Solomon and Hezekiah apparently had them in great quantity. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 10:11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 9:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/2/2\" data-bid=\"3-3\" class=\"b\"> 32:27</a>) Precious stones were given as gifts (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 10:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/3/2\" data-bid=\"4-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ch 9:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/3/3\" data-bid=\"4-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;9</a>), might constitute part of war booty (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">2Sa 12:29, 30;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Ch 20:2</a>), and, as among the ancient Tyrians, were used as articles of trade (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;22</a>). In an inspired dirge concerning &#x201C;the king of Tyre,&#x201D; Ezekiel stated: &#x201C;Every precious stone was your covering, ruby, topaz and jasper; chrysolite, onyx and jade; sapphire, turquoise and emerald; and of gold was the workmanship of your settings and your sockets in you.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 28:12,&#xA0;13</a>) Symbolic Babylon the Great is represented as being richly adorned with precious stones.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Re 17:3-5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:11-17</a>.While the ancients rounded and polished precious stones, generally they do not seem to have angled, or faceted, them, as do craftsmen of modern times. The emery stone (corundum) or emery powder was employed by the Hebrews and Egyptians to polish precious stones. Often these were sculptured and engraved. The Hebrews apparently knew how to engrave precious stones long before their bondage in Egypt, where engraving was also an art. Judah&#x2019;s seal ring had evidently been engraved.

And the second row was turquoise, sapphire and jasper. And the third row was <em>lesh&#x2B9;em </em>stone, agate and amethyst. And the fourth row was chrysolite and onyx and jade. They were set with settings of gold in their fillings.&#x201D; The name of one of Israel&#x2019;s 12 tribes was inscribed on each of these stones.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 39:6-14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> 28:9-21</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/9\">BREASTPIECE</a>.Though Jehovah would not permit David to build the temple in Jerusalem (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 22:6-10</a>), the aged king joyfully prepared valuable materials <span id=\"page75\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"75\" data-before-text=\"75\"></span>for its construction, including &#x201C;onyx stones, and stones to be set with hard mortar, and mosaic pebbles, and every precious stone, and alabaster stones in great quantity.&#x201D; He made substantial contributions of materials, and the people in general also contributed.

He indicated that the choice materials would include figurative &#x201C;precious stones&#x201D; capable of withstanding the force of &#x201C;fire.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002461/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 3:10-15</a>.Precious stones are sometimes used Scripturally to symbolize qualities of heavenly or spiritual things or persons. The heavens were opened for Ezekiel, and in two visions he beheld four winged living creatures accompanied by four wheels, the appearance of each wheel being likened to &#x201C;the glow of chrysolite,&#x201D; that is, having a hue of yellow or possibly green.
