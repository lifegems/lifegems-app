In the Masoretic text the name was intentionally vowel pointed to correspond with the Hebrew word <em>shiq&#xB7;quts&#x2B9; </em>(disgusting thing). In the Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>&#x201C;Kaiwan&#x201D; is rendered <em>Rhai&#xB7;phan&#x2B9;, </em>presumably the Egyptian designation for Saturn; and in Stephen&#x2019;s quotation, at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002568/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Acts 7:43</a>, <em>Rhom&#xB7;pha&#x2B9; </em>appears in the Westcott and Hort Greek text.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002568/0\">ASTROLOGERS</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002568/1\">REPHAN</a>."}
