On this basis some have considered the prophecy to apply to the period of time during which the geographic site of the ancient city of Jerusalem would be under Gentile domination and control.While the literal city of Jerusalem is obviously referred to in Jesus&#x2019; description of the destruction that was to come and did come upon that city in the year 70&#xA0;C.E. when the Romans demolished Jerusalem, the statement concerning &#x201C;the appointed times of the nations&#x201D; carries the prophecy far beyond that point, as many commentators have noted. Thus, the well-known <em>Commentary </em>by F.&#xA0;C.&#xA0;Cook says of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 21:24</a>: &#x201C;It serves to separate the strictly eschatological portion [that is, the portion relating to the last days] of the great prophecy, from the part belonging properly to the destruction of Jerusalem.&#x201D; So, it becomes essential to determine what significance the inspired Scriptures attach to &#x201C;Jerusalem&#x201D; in order to ascertain whether &#x201C;the appointed times of the nations&#x201D; relate only to the literal city of Jerusalem or to something additional and greater.Jerusalem was the capital of the nation of Israel, whose kings of the line of David were said to &#x201C;sit upon Jehovah&#x2019;s throne.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 29:23</a>) As such, it represented the seat of the divinely constituted government or typical kingdom of God operating through the house of David.

After Jerusalem <span id=\"page133\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"133\" data-before-text=\"133\"></span>was trampled on by the Babylonians, its king being taken into exile and the land laid desolate, no member of the Davidic dynasty again ruled from earthly Jerusalem. But the Scriptures show that Jesus, the Messiah, who was born in the line of David, would rule from heavenly Mount Zion, from heavenly Jerusalem.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 2:6,&#xA0;7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/11/1\" data-bid=\"12-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 5:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/11/2\" data-bid=\"12-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 14:1,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/11/3\" data-bid=\"12-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;3</a>.<strong><em>Beginning of &#x2018;trampling.&#x2019; </em></strong>The &#x2018;trampling&#x2019; on that kingdom of the dynasty of Davidic rulers did not begin with the Roman devastation of the city of Jerusalem in 70&#xA0;C.E. It began centuries earlier with the Babylonian overthrow of that dynasty in 607&#xA0;B.C.E. when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and took captive the dethroned king Zedekiah and the land was left desolate.

In the book of Daniel we find a picture drawn of the domination of the earth by the Gentile powers during their &#x201C;appointed times.&#x201D; The <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">second chapter of Daniel</a> contains the prophetic vision (received by King Nebuchadnezzar) of the great image that Daniel by inspiration showed to represent the march of Gentile world powers, ending with their destruction by the Kingdom set up by &#x201C;the God of heaven,&#x201D; which Kingdom then rules earth wide. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Da 2:31-45</a>) It is of note that the image begins with the Babylonian Empire, the first world power to &#x2018;trample Jerusalem&#x2019; by overthrowing the Davidic dynasty and leaving &#x201C;Jehovah&#x2019;s throne&#x201D; in Jerusalem vacant. This also confirms the start of &#x201C;the appointed times of the nations&#x201D; in the year of Jerusalem&#x2019;s destruction, 607&#xA0;B.C.E.<strong><em>Dream vision of tree in </em></strong><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\"><strong><em>Daniel chapter&#xA0;4</em></strong></a><strong><em>. </em></strong>Again in the book of Daniel we find a close parallel to Jesus&#x2019; use of the word &#x201C;times&#x201D; with regard to &#x201C;the nations,&#x201D; or Gentile powers. And again it is Nebuchadnezzar, the dethroner of David&#x2019;s descendant Zedekiah, who was given another vision interpreted by Daniel as relating to divinely appointed kingship. The symbolic vision was of an immense tree; an angel from heaven commanded that it be chopped down. Its stump was then banded with iron and copper and had to stay that way among the grass of the field until &#x201C;seven times&#x201D; passed over it. &#x201C;Let its heart be changed from that of mankind, and let the heart of a beast be given to it, and let seven times pass over it .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. to the intent that people living may know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind and that to the one whom he wants to, he gives it and he sets up over it even the lowliest one of mankind.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Da 4:10-17; </a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/23/1\" data-bid=\"24-2\" class=\"b\">see 4:16</a>, ftn.<strong><em>Related to &#x201C;appointed times of the nations.&#x201D; </em></strong>The vision definitely had a fulfillment in Nebuchadnezzar himself.

Therefore, some view it as having direct prophetic application only to him and see in this vision merely the presentation of the eternal verity of &#x2018;God&#x2019;s supremacy over all other powers<wbr>&#x2014;human or supposedly divine.&#x2019; They acknowledge the application of that <em>truth </em>or <em>principle </em>beyond Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s own case but do not see it as relating to any specific time period or divine schedule. Yet, an examination of the entire book of Daniel reveals that the element of time is everywhere prominent in the visions and prophecies it presents; and the world powers and events described in each such vision are shown, not as isolated or as occurring at random with the time element left ambiguous, but, rather, as fitting into a historical setting or time sequence.

The tree is shown to have an application to Nebuchadnezzar, who at that point in history was the head of the dominant World Power, Babylon. Yet, prior to Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s conquest of Jerusalem, the typical kingdom of God ruling out of that city was the agency by which Jehovah expressed his rightful sovereignty toward the earth. It thus constituted a divine block or impediment for Nebuchadnezzar in attaining his goal of world domination. By allowing that typical kingdom at Jerusalem to be overthrown, Jehovah permitted his own visible expression of sovereignty through the Davidic dynasty of kings to be cut down. The expression and exercise of world domination in &#x201C;the kingdom of mankind,&#x201D; unhindered by any representative kingdom of God, now passed into the hands of the Gentile nations. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/33/0\" data-bid=\"34-1\" class=\"b\">La 1:5;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/33/1\" data-bid=\"34-2\" class=\"b\"> 2:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/33/2\" data-bid=\"34-3\" class=\"b\"> 16,&#xA0;17</a>) In the light of these facts &#x201C;the tree&#x201D; is seen to represent, beyond and above its application to Nebuchadnezzar, world sovereignty or domination by God&#x2019;s arrangement.<strong><em>Renewal of world domination. </em></strong>God, however, here makes clear that he has not forever delivered up such world domination to the Gentile powers. The vision shows that God&#x2019;s self-restraint (represented by the bands of iron and of copper around the stump of the tree) would continue until &#x201C;seven times pass over it.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Da 4:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/34/1\" data-bid=\"35-2\" class=\"b\"> 23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/34/2\" data-bid=\"35-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;25</a>) Then, since &#x201C;the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind,&#x201D; God would give world domination &#x201C;to the one whom he wants to.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Da 4:17</a>) The prophetic book of Daniel itself shows that one to be the &#x201C;son of man&#x201D; to whom are given &#x201C;rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Da 7:13,&#xA0;14</a>) Jesus&#x2019; own prophecy, in which the reference to &#x201C;the appointed times of the nations&#x201D; occurs, points definitely toward Christ Jesus&#x2019; exercise of such world domination as God&#x2019;s chosen King, the heir of the Davidic dynasty. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 24:30, 31;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/37/1\" data-bid=\"38-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 21:27-31,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/37/2\" data-bid=\"38-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;36</a>) Thus, the symbolic stump, representing God&#x2019;s retention of the sovereign right to exercise world domination in &#x201C;the kingdom of mankind,&#x201D; was due to sprout again in his Son&#x2019;s Kingdom.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/38/0\" data-bid=\"39-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 89:27,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/38/1\" data-bid=\"39-2\" class=\"b\"> 35-37</a>.<strong>Seven Symbolic Times. </strong>In Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s personal experience of the vision&#x2019;s fulfillment the &#x201C;seven times&#x201D; were evidently seven years, during which he became mad, with symptoms like those of lycanthropy, abandoning his throne to eat grass like a beast in the field. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/39/0\" data-bid=\"40-1\" class=\"b\">Da 4:31-36</a>) Notably, the Biblical description of the exercise of world domination by the Gentile powers is presented through the figure of beasts in opposition to the holy people of God and their &#x201C;Prince of princes.&#x201D; (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Da 7:2-8,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> 12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/40/2\" data-bid=\"41-3\" class=\"b\"> 17-26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/40/3\" data-bid=\"41-4\" class=\"b\"> 8:3-12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/40/4\" data-bid=\"41-5\" class=\"b\"> 20-25;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/40/5\" data-bid=\"41-6\" class=\"b\"> Re 11:7;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/40/6\" data-bid=\"41-7\" class=\"b\"> 13:1-11;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/40/7\" data-bid=\"41-8\" class=\"b\"> 17:7-14</a>.) Concerning the word &#x201C;times&#x201D; (from Aramaic <em>&#x2BD;id&#xB7;dan&#x2B9;</em>), as used in Daniel&#x2019;s prophecy, lexicographers show it here to mean &#x201C;years.&#x201D; <span id=\"page135\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"135\" data-before-text=\"135\"></span>(See <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>by L.&#xA0;Koehler and W.&#xA0;Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;1106; <em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, </em>by Brown, Driver, and Briggs, 1980, p.&#xA0;1105; <em>Lexicon Linguae Aramaicae Veteris Testamenti, </em>edited by E.&#xA0;Vogt, Rome, 1971, p.&#xA0;124.) The duration of a year as so used is indicated to be 360 days, inasmuch as three and a half times are shown to equal &#x201C;a thousand two hundred and sixty days&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Revelation 12:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/41/1\" data-bid=\"42-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;14</a>.

That a specific number of days may be used in the Bible record to represent prophetically an equivalent number of years can be seen by reading the accounts at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Numbers 14:34</a> and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Ezekiel 4:6</a>. Only by applying the formula there expressed of &#x201C;a day for a year&#x201D; to the &#x201C;seven times&#x201D; of this prophecy can the vision of <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Daniel chapter&#xA0;4</a> have significant fulfillment beyond the day of now extinct Nebuchadnezzar, as the evidence thus far presented gives reason to expect. They therefore represent 2,520 years.It is a historical fact worth noting that, on the basis of the points and evidence above presented, the March&#xA0;1880 edition of the <em>Watch Tower </em>magazine identified the year 1914 as the time for the close of &#x201C;the appointed times of the nations&#x201D; (and the end of the lease of power granted the Gentile rulers). This was some 34 years before the arrival of that year and the momentous events it initiated. In the August&#xA0;30, 1914, edition of <em>The World, </em>a leading New York newspaper at that time, a feature article in the paper&#x2019;s Sunday magazine section commented on this as follows: &#x201C;The terrific war outbreak in Europe has fulfilled an extraordinary prophecy. For a quarter of a century past, through preachers and through press, the &#x2018;International Bible Students&#x2019; .&#xA0;.&#xA0;. have been proclaiming to the world that the Day of Wrath prophesied in the Bible would dawn in 1914.&#x201D;The events that took place from and after the year 1914&#xA0;C.E. are well-known history to all, beginning with the great war that erupted, the first <em>world </em>war in mankind&#x2019;s history and the first to be fought over the issue, not of the domination of Europe alone, nor of Africa, nor of Asia, but of <em>the domination of the world.<wbr></em>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 21:7-24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> 29-33;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/46/2\" data-bid=\"47-3\" class=\"b\"> Re 11:15-18</a>; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/1\">LAST DAYS</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000316/2\">PRESENCE</a>."}
