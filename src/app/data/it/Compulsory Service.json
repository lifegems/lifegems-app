It can apply to corv&#xE9;e, that is, unpaid or partially unpaid work that an authority imposes on certain people, such as residents of a particular area.The psalmist, in reflecting on the deliverance of Israel from Egyptian bondage, represented Jehovah as saying: &#x201C;I turned aside his shoulder even from the burden [or compulsory service].&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 81:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> Ex 1:11</a>) King Solomon conscripted men for forced labor for various building projects and placed foremen over them.

Thus Jerusalem was to be told that her &#x201C;military service&#x201D; had been fulfilled and her error had been paid off. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 40:1, 2</a>, ftn) When under test, distressed and pain-racked Job likened life to hard, fatiguing service or &#x201C;compulsory labor,&#x201D; asking: &#x201C;Is there not a compulsory labor for mortal man on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired laborer?&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Job 7:1</a>) With similar sentiment, he later said to God: &#x201C;You will make your vexation with me greater; hardship after hardship is with me,&#x201D; or &#x201C;one shift of compulsory labor after another is with me.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Job 10:17</a>, ftn) Job evidently felt that God was adding to his affliction by bringing one new hardship after another upon him. Job also likened the time that the dead spend in Sheol to compulsory labor, a burden that is enforced; yet he expressed hope in a resurrection.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Job 14:14</a>."}
