Often a deliberate refusal to comply with God&#x2019;s will or commands is involved.

Jehovah brought ten devastating plagues upon the land of Egypt. Each time that Pharaoh hardened his heart after a certain plague ended, Jehovah used this as an opportunity to demonstrate his great power still further by other miracles. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004251/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 7:3-5,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004251/7/1\" data-bid=\"8-2\" class=\"b\"> 14&#x2013;11:10</a>) Therefore, some of the Egyptians came to realize that Jehovah is a God who has to be obeyed. For example, when the seventh plague was announced, even some of Pharaoh&#x2019;s servants saw to it that their own servants and livestock were safely sheltered before the destructive hailstorm began. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004251/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 9:20,&#xA0;21</a>) Finally, when Pharaoh, after having released the Israelites, again made his heart obstinate and mustered his forces to wreak vengeance upon them (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004251/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 14:8,&#xA0;9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004251/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:9</a>), Jehovah destroyed him and his army in the Red Sea.

Said Jehovah, through the prophet Isaiah, to obstinate Israelites: &#x201C;Due to my knowing that you are hard and that your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead is copper, I also kept telling you from that time. Before it could come in, I caused you to hear it, that you might not say, &#x2018;My own idol has done them, and my own carved image and my own molten image have commanded them.&#x2019;&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004251/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 48:4,&#xA0;5</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004251/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 44:16-23</a>."}
