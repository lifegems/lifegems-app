Shealtiel is called the son both of Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) and of Neri. Both Shealtiel and his brother Pedaiah are called the father of postexilic Governor Zerubbabel.As to Shealtiel&#x2019;s father: Shealtiel is listed first among the sons born to Jehoiachin during his exile.

This would be the same as Luke&#x2019;s later referring to Joseph, who took Mary (apparently Heli&#x2019;s daughter) in marriage, as being &#x201C;of Heli.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003967/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 3:23,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003967/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;27</a>.As to Zerubbabel&#x2019;s father: Pedaiah is once so identified (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003967/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 3:19</a>), but Pedaiah&#x2019;s brother Shealtiel (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003967/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">1Ch 3:17,&#xA0;18</a>) is so termed in all other instances.

Or, if Shealtiel died childless and Pedaiah performed levirate marriage on his behalf, the son of Pedaiah by Shealtiel&#x2019;s wife would have been the legal heir of Shealtiel."}
