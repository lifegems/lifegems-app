The dull-gray metal was useful as weight on fishlines and nets and for heavy lids, or covers. Moses poetically sang in triumph that the Egyptians &#x201C;sank like lead [Heb., <em>&#x2BD;o&#xB7;phe&#x2B9;reth</em>]&#x201D; in the Red Sea.

It was mined in the Arabah between the S end of the Dead Sea and the Gulf of &#x2BD;Aqaba. Tarshish (Spain) was another source of supply. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002700/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:12</a>) Lead ore had to be smelted in a furnace like the ores of other metals.

The first step in the refining process converted lead sulfide to lead oxide, which was itself sometimes used as a pottery glaze, as is evidenced in the ruins of Egypt and Nineveh.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002700/0\">REFINE, REFINER</a>."}
