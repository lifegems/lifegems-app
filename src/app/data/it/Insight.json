To act with insight is to act with prudence, discretion. According to Wilson&#x2019;s <em>Old Testament Word Studies, </em>the Hebrew verb <em>sa&#xB7;khal&#x2B9; </em>means &#x201C;to look at; to be prudent, circumspect; to act prudently, to be intelligent.&#x201D; (1978, p.&#xA0;461) Thus, <em>sa&#xB7;khal&#x2B9; </em>is rendered &#x2018;have insight&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 14:2</a>), &#x2018;act with discretion&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 10:19</a>), &#x201C;act prudently&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 18:5</a>), &#x2018;have success&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 17:8</a>), &#x2018;cause to show insight&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 16:23</a>). The noun <em>se&#x2B9;khel </em>is translated &#x201C;insight&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 111:10</a>) and &#x201C;discretion.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 25:3</a>.Insight is closely related to understanding, but there is a fine distinction between the two terms. Says the <em>Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament: </em>&#x201C;While <em>bin </em>[understanding] indicates &#x2018;distinguishing between,&#x2019; [<em>sa&#xB7;khal&#x2B9;</em>] relates to an intelligent knowledge of the reason. There is the process of thinking through a complex arrangement of thoughts resulting in a wise dealing and use of good practical common sense. Another end result is the emphasis upon being successful.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Edited by R.&#xA0;L.&#xA0;Harris, 1980, Vol.&#xA0;2, p.&#xA0;877; see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/0\">UNDERSTANDING</a>.In the Greek Scriptures, the verb <em>sy&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;e&#xB7;mi </em>is translated &#x2018;has insight&#x2019; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Romans 3:11</a>, where the apostle Paul quotes from <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 14:2</a>. <em>Sy&#xB7;ni&#x2B9;e&#xB7;mi </em>is also rendered &#x201C;get the sense of&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 13:13-15</a>), &#x2018;grasp&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/10/0\" data-bid=\"11-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 16:12</a>), &#x201C;understand&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 28:26</a>), and &#x2018;perceive&#x2019; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 5:17</a>).Jehovah God gives insight to his servants by providing them with counsel and advice that they can use to direct their steps and control their actions.

He provides such wise guidance by means of his Word. To gain insight, though, a person must do more than read the Bible. He must appreciate it so as to be motivated to do all that God directs.

Once acquired, insight must be safeguarded. One can lose it by turning from God&#x2019;s ways.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 36:1-3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> Pr 21:16</a>.Insight can be displayed in various ways, resulting in blessings both to the one who has it and to others. The psalmist pronounces happy the one &#x201C;acting with consideration [with insight] toward the lowly one.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 41:1</a>) A wife who is &#x201C;discreet&#x201D; (showing insight) is described as a blessing from Jehovah. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/20/0\" data-bid=\"21-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 19:14</a>) Insight, looking beyond the obvious, enables one to guard his mouth (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/21/0\" data-bid=\"22-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 10:19;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/21/1\" data-bid=\"22-2\" class=\"b\"> 16:23</a>) and to know when to keep silent. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/22/0\" data-bid=\"23-1\" class=\"b\">Am 5:13</a>) It also helps one to avoid anger and overlook transgression. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/23/0\" data-bid=\"24-1\" class=\"b\">Pr 19:11</a>) One who has insight accepts correction. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/24/0\" data-bid=\"25-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 2:10</a>) According to <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002176/25/0\" data-bid=\"26-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 21:11</a>, when a wise person obtains insight<wbr>&#x2014;that is, when he carefully considers available information and as a result acquires a clearer picture of a matter&#x2014;<wbr>he &#x201C;gets knowledge,&#x201D; that is, he knows what to do regarding the matter, what conclusions to draw, what counsel to give."}
