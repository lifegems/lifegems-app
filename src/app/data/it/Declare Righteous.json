In the Bible it is used to mean &#x201C;reckon, credit, count, or take into account.&#x201D; Thus <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Corinthians 13:5</a> says that love &#x201C;does not keep account [form of <em>lo&#xB7;gi&#x2B9;zo&#xB7;mai</em>] of the injury&#x201D; (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 4:16</a>); and the psalmist David is quoted as saying: &#x201C;Happy is the man whose sin Jehovah will by no means take into account.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 4:8</a>) Paul showed to those who looked at things according to their face value the need to make a proper evaluation of matters, to look at both sides of the ledger, as it were.

Finishing his earthly course free from flaw in any sense of the word, Jesus was acknowledged by God as justified.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:33,&#xA0;34</a>) Why does God take this action toward them?First, it is because Jehovah is perfect and holy (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 6:3</a>); hence, in harmony with his holiness, those whom he accepts as his sons must be perfect. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">De 32:4,&#xA0;5</a>) Jesus Christ, God&#x2019;s chief Son, showed himself perfect, &#x201C;loyal, guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:26</a>) His followers, however, are taken from among the sons of Adam, who, because of sin, fathered an imperfect, sinful family.

By his undeserved kindness, Jehovah God arranged a process of &#x201C;adoption&#x201D; through which he accepts such favored ones and brings them into a spiritual relationship as part of his family of sons. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/40/0\" data-bid=\"41-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 8:15, 16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/40/1\" data-bid=\"41-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Jo 3:1</a>) Consequently, God lays the basis for their entry into or their adoption to sonship by declaring them righteous through the merit of Christ&#x2019;s ransom sacrifice in which they exercise faith, acquitting them of all guilt due to sin. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/41/0\" data-bid=\"42-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 5:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/41/1\" data-bid=\"42-2\" class=\"b\"> 8-11</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:12</a>.) They are, therefore, &#x201C;counted,&#x201D; or credited, as being completely righteous persons, all their sins being forgiven and not charged against them.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 4:6-8;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/43/1\" data-bid=\"44-2\" class=\"b\"> 8:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/43/2\" data-bid=\"44-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 10:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/43/3\" data-bid=\"44-4\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;14</a>.This declaring of such Christians righteous, therefore, goes much farther than in the case of Abraham (and other pre-Christian servants of Jehovah), previously discussed. Indicating the scope of Abraham&#x2019;s justification, the disciple James wrote: &#x201C;The scripture was fulfilled which says: &#x2018;Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness,&#x2019; and he came to be called &#x2018;Jehovah&#x2019;s friend.&#x2019;&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 2:20-23</a>) So, because of his faith, Abraham was declared righteous <em>as a friend of God, </em>not as a son of God because of being &#x201C;born again&#x201D; with heavenly life in view. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 3:3</a>) The Scriptural record makes clear that prior to Christ&#x2019;s coming neither such sonship nor such a heavenly hope had been opened up to men.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 1:12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/46/1\" data-bid=\"47-2\" class=\"b\"> 17, 18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/46/2\" data-bid=\"47-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Ti 1:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/46/3\" data-bid=\"47-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Pe 1:3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/46/4\" data-bid=\"47-5\" class=\"b\"> 1Jo 3:1</a>.It can be seen that, though enjoying the status of righteous persons before God, these Christians do not possess actual or literal perfection in the flesh.
