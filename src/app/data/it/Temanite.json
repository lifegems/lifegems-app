An early Edomite king, Husham, came from &#x201C;the land of the Temanites,&#x201D; and Eliphaz, one of Job&#x2019;s three companions, was a Temanite.

Some scholars, however, believe that there is a possibility that the Eliphaz named in the book of Job was, not from Teman, but from Tema, a place identified with an oasis on the Arabian Peninsula about 400&#xA0;km (250&#xA0;mi) SE of Ezion-geber.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004357/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job 6:19</a>."}
