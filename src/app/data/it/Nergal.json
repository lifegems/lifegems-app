The people of Cuth (Cuthah), whom the king of Assyria settled in the territory of Samaria, continued worshiping this deity. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003228/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2Ki 17:24,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003228/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 30,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003228/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;33</a>) Some scholars suggest that Nergal was originally associated with fire and the heat of the sun and that later he came to be regarded as a god of war and hunting as well as a bringer of pestilence. The appellatives applied to Nergal in religious texts indicate that he was basically viewed as a destroyer. He is called &#x201C;the raging king,&#x201D; &#x201C;the violent one,&#x201D; and &#x201C;the one who burns.&#x201D; Nergal also came to be regarded as the god of the underworld and the consort of Eresh-Kigal. The human-headed and winged lion is thought to have been the emblem of Nergal.Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, one of King Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s princes, was evidently named after this god.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003228/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 39:3,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003228/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;13</a>."}
