This location on the coastal plain has caused some discussion as to the meaning of the frequently used phrase &#x201C;the mountain ridges [from the Heb. <em>na&#xB7;phah&#x2B9;</em>] of Dor.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001213/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 11:2</a>) Some scholars believe this refers to the cliffs that line much of the coast in this region, thus associating the Hebrew <em>na&#xB7;phah&#x2B9; </em>with the Arabic term <em>nafnaf, </em>meaning &#x201C;cliff, precipice.&#x201D; Others believe it may indicate the hilly slopes that begin 3&#xA0;km (2&#xA0;mi) inland from Dor and culminate in the heights of Mount Carmel."}
