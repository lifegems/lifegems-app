Mere speech to God is not necessarily prayer, as is seen in the judgment in Eden and in the case of Cain.

The various Hebrew and Greek words relating to prayer convey such ideas as to ask, make request, petition, entreat, supplicate, plead, beseech, beg, implore favor, seek, inquire of, as well as to praise, thank, and bless.Petitions and supplications, of course, can be made to men, and the original-language words are sometimes so used (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 44:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 50:17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> Ac 25:11</a>), but &#x201C;prayer,&#x201D; used in a <em>religious </em>sense, does not apply to such cases. One might &#x201C;beseech&#x201D; or &#x201C;implore&#x201D; another person to do something, but in so doing he would not view this individual as his God. He would not, for example, silently petition such one, nor do so when the individual was not visibly present, as one does in prayer to God.<strong>The &#x201C;Hearer of Prayer.&#x201D; </strong>The entire Scriptural record testifies that Jehovah is the One to whom prayer should be directed (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 5:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Mt 6:9</a>), that he is the &#x201C;Hearer of prayer&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 65:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 66:19</a>) and has power to act in behalf of the petitioners.

True, there are rare instances in which words are addressed to Jesus Christ in heaven. Stephen, when about to die, appealed to Jesus, saying, &#x201C;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 7:59</a>) However, the context reveals a circumstance giving basis for this exceptional expression. Stephen at that very <span id=\"page668\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"668\" data-before-text=\"668\"></span>time had a vision of &#x201C;Jesus standing at God&#x2019;s right hand,&#x201D; and evidently reacting as if he were in Jesus&#x2019; personal presence, he felt free to speak this plea to the one whom he recognized as the head of the Christian congregation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 7:55, 56;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/9/1\" data-bid=\"10-2\" class=\"b\"> Col 1:18</a>) Similarly, the apostle John, at the conclusion of the Revelation, says, &#x201C;Amen!

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/12/0\" data-bid=\"13-1\" class=\"b\">Re 22:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/12/1\" data-bid=\"13-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;20</a>) In both cases, that of Stephen and that of John, the situation differs little from that of the conversation John had with a heavenly person in this Revelation vision. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/13/0\" data-bid=\"14-1\" class=\"b\">Re 7:13, 14</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/14/0\" data-bid=\"15-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 22:6-22</a>.) There is nothing to indicate that Christian disciples so expressed themselves under other circumstances to Jesus after his ascension to heaven. Thus, the apostle Paul writes: &#x201C;In <em>everything </em>by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known <em>to God.&#x201D;<wbr></em>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">Php 4:6</a>.The article <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/0\">APPROACH TO GOD</a> considers the position of Christ Jesus as the one <em>through </em>whom prayer is directed. Through Jesus&#x2019; blood, offered to God in sacrifice, &#x201C;we have boldness for the way of entry into the holy place,&#x201D; that is, boldness to approach God&#x2019;s presence in prayer, approaching &#x201C;with true hearts in the full assurance of faith.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:19-22</a>) Jesus Christ is therefore the one and only &#x201C;way&#x201D; of reconciliation with God and approach to God in prayer.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/17/0\" data-bid=\"18-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 14:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/17/1\" data-bid=\"18-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/17/2\" data-bid=\"18-3\" class=\"b\"> 16:23, 24;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/17/3\" data-bid=\"18-4\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 1:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/17/4\" data-bid=\"18-5\" class=\"b\"> Eph 2:18</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/1\">JESUS CHRIST</a> (His Vital Place in God&#x2019;s Purpose).<strong>Those Whom God Hears. </strong>People &#x201C;of all flesh&#x201D; may come to the &#x201C;Hearer of prayer,&#x201D; Jehovah God.

The prayer given by Jesus to his disciples was evidently a model, or a basic pattern, because later prayers by Jesus himself, as well as by his disciples, did not rigidly adhere to the specific words of his model prayer. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:9-13</a>) In its initial words, this prayer concentrates on the matter of primary concern, the sanctification of Jehovah&#x2019;s <span id=\"page669\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"669\" data-before-text=\"669\"></span>name, which name began to be profaned by the rebellion in Eden, as well as on the realization of the divine will by means of the promised Kingdom, which government is headed by the prophesied Seed, the Messiah.

Such prayer requires that the one praying be definitely on God&#x2019;s side in the issue involving Jehovah&#x2019;s sovereignty.Jesus&#x2019; parable at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/46/0\" data-bid=\"47-1\" class=\"b\">Luke 19:11-27</a> shows what the &#x2018;coming of the Kingdom&#x2019; means<wbr>&#x2014;its coming to execute judgment, to destroy all opposers, and to bring relief and reward to those hoping in it. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Re 16:14-16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/47/1\" data-bid=\"48-2\" class=\"b\"> 19:11-21</a>.) The following expression, &#x201C;let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth,&#x201D; thus refers primarily, not to the doing of God&#x2019;s will by humans, but, rather, to God&#x2019;s own acting in fulfillment of his will toward the earth and its inhabitants, manifesting his power to realize his declared purpose. The person praying, of course, also expresses thereby his own preference for, and submission to, that will. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:10</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 26:39</a>.) The request for daily bread, forgiveness, protection against temptation, and deliverance from the wicked one all relate to the petitioner&#x2019;s desire to continue living in God&#x2019;s favor. He expresses this desire for all others of like faith, not for himself alone.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Col 4:12</a>.These matters in this model prayer are of fundamental importance to all men of faith and express needs they all have in common. The Scriptural account shows that there are, on the other hand, many other matters that may affect individuals to a greater or lesser degree or that result from particular circumstances or occasions and that are also proper subjects for prayer.

The apostle shows that this is by means of God&#x2019;s spirit, or active force. It should be remembered that it was by his spirit that God inspired the Scriptures.

Even then, with the exception of when he spoke to or about his Son while on earth, God&#x2019;s words were evidently transmitted through angels. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/85/0\" data-bid=\"86-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 3:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/85/1\" data-bid=\"86-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/85/2\" data-bid=\"86-3\" class=\"b\"> Ga 3:19</a>.) Messages delivered personally by materialized angels were likewise uncommon, as is evidenced by the disturbed effect they generally produced on the receivers. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/86/0\" data-bid=\"87-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 6:22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/86/1\" data-bid=\"87-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 1:11, 12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/86/2\" data-bid=\"87-3\" class=\"b\"> 26-30</a>) The answering of prayers in the majority of cases, therefore, was through prophets or by the granting of, or the refusal to grant, the request. Jehovah&#x2019;s answers to prayers often had a clearly recognizable effect, as when he delivered his servants from their enemies (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/87/0\" data-bid=\"88-1\" class=\"b\">2Ch 20:1-12,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/87/1\" data-bid=\"88-2\" class=\"b\"> 21-24</a>) or when he provided for their physical needs in times of dire scarcity. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/88/0\" data-bid=\"89-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 15:22-25</a>) But undoubtedly the most frequent answer was not so easily discernible, since it related to giving moral strength and enlightenment, enabling the person to hold to a righteous course and carry out divinely assigned work. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/89/0\" data-bid=\"90-1\" class=\"b\">2Ti 4:17</a>) Particularly for the Christian the answer to prayers involved matters mainly spiritual, not as spectacular as some powerful acts of God in earlier times, but equally vital.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/90/0\" data-bid=\"91-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 9:36-38;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/90/1\" data-bid=\"91-2\" class=\"b\"> Col 1:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/90/2\" data-bid=\"91-3\" class=\"b\"> Heb 13:18;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/90/3\" data-bid=\"91-4\" class=\"b\"> Jas 5:13</a>.Acceptable prayer must be made to the right person, Jehovah God; on right matters, those in harmony with God&#x2019;s declared purposes; in the right manner, through God&#x2019;s appointed way, Christ Jesus; and with a right motive and a clean heart. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/91/0\" data-bid=\"92-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 4:3-6</a>.) Along with all of this, there is need for persistence. Jesus said to &#x2018;keep on asking, seeking, and knocking,&#x2019; not giving up. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/92/0\" data-bid=\"93-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 11:5-10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/92/1\" data-bid=\"93-2\" class=\"b\"> 18:1-7</a>) He raised the question as to whether, at his future &#x2018;arrival,&#x2019; he would find faith in the power of prayer on earth. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/93/0\" data-bid=\"94-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 18:8</a>) The seeming delay on God&#x2019;s part in answering some prayers is not due to any inability nor to a lack of willingness, as the Scriptures make clear.

The power of intercessory prayer is regularly stressed, whether by an individual or a collective group. It was in regard to &#x2018;praying for one another&#x2019; that James said: &#x201C;A righteous man&#x2019;s supplication, when it is at work, has much force.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/103/0\" data-bid=\"104-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 5:14-20</a>; compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/104/0\" data-bid=\"105-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 20:7,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/104/1\" data-bid=\"105-2\" class=\"b\"> 17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/104/2\" data-bid=\"105-3\" class=\"b\"> 2Th 3:1,&#xA0;2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/104/3\" data-bid=\"105-4\" class=\"b\"> Heb 13:18,&#xA0;19</a>.Also notable is the frequent &#x2018;pleading&#x2019; of one&#x2019;s case before Jehovah, the Sovereign Ruler. The petitioner presents reasons why he believes the request to be right, evidence of his having a right and unselfish motive, and reasoning to show that there are other factors outweighing his own interests or considerations.
