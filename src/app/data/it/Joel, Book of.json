From his references to Judah, Jerusalem, and Jehovah&#x2019;s house there, it may be inferred that he prophesied in Judah and perhaps resided in Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">1:9,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/1/2\" data-bid=\"2-3\" class=\"b\"> 2:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/1/3\" data-bid=\"2-4\" class=\"b\"> 32;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/1/4\" data-bid=\"2-5\" class=\"b\"> 3:1, 2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/1/5\" data-bid=\"2-6\" class=\"b\"> 16-20</a>) The fact that he mentioned &#x201C;the low plain of Jehoshaphat&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">3:2,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;12</a>) implies that he wrote his book after Jehovah&#x2019;s great victory on behalf of King Jehoshaphat. But the exact period involved is in question.<strong>Time of Writing. </strong>Scholars variously assign the book of Joel dates from before 800&#xA0;B.C.E. to about 400&#xA0;B.C.E. Regarding their arguments in favor of a late or an early composition for the book, <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclop&#xE6;dia </em>(edited by James Orr, 1960, Vol.&#xA0;III, p.&#xA0;1690) observes: &#x201C;Many of the arguments adduced are of a negative kind, i.e. consideration of what the prophet does <em>not </em>mention or refer to [including the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, a Judean king, and the ten-tribe kingdom], and the argument from silence is notoriously precarious.&#x201D; Similarly, whether Joel quoted other prophets or was quoted by them cannot be established with certainty. A date after the Babylonian exile would be indicated if <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joel (2:32</a>) quoted <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Obadiah (17</a>). On the other hand, not only Obadiah but even the much earlier prophet Amos (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Joe 3:16</a> with <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Am 1:2</a>) may have quoted from Joel. This would mean that Joel wrote his book no later than the time of Uzziah (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Am 1:1</a>), perhaps about 820&#xA0;B.C.E. Though not conclusive, the place occupied by the book of Joel in the Hebrew canon between Hosea and Amos seems to favor the earlier period.<strong>Authenticity. </strong>The Jews did not question the canonicity of the book of Joel but placed it second among the &#x201C;minor&#x201D; prophets. It also harmonizes completely with the rest of the Scriptures, as is evident from the numerous parallels between Joel and other Bible books.

The fulfillment of Joel&#x2019;s prophecies furnishes yet another argument for its authenticity. As foretold, Tyre, Philistia, and Edom experienced Jehovah&#x2019;s judgments. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Joe 3:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> 19</a>; for details, see <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/0\">EDOM, EDOMITES</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/1\">PHILISTIA, PHILISTINES</a>; <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002482/2-3\">TYRE</a>.) On the day of Pentecost in the year 33&#xA0;C.E., the apostle Peter showed that the outpouring of God&#x2019;s spirit upon the disciples of Jesus Christ was a fulfillment of Joel&#x2019;s prophecy.
