The parchment is rolled up and placed in a wooden, metal, or glass case that is affixed in a slanting position on the right-hand doorpost of Orthodox Jewish dwellings, the upper part pointing inward and the lower part outward. The Hebrew word <em>Shad&#xB7;dai&#x2B9; </em>(meaning &#x201C;Almighty&#x201D;) is written on the back of this parchment and is frequently visible through a glass-covered opening in the container. Sometimes the mezuzah case is artistically decorated. When pious Orthodox Jews enter or leave a house, they touch the mezuzah with the hand and recite the prayer, &#x201C;May God keep my going out and my coming in from now on and ever more.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003027/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 121:8</a>.The use of the mezuzah is based on a literal interpretation of the command at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003027/8/0\" data-bid=\"9-1\" class=\"b\">Deuteronomy 6:9</a> (ftn) and <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003027/9/0\" data-bid=\"10-1\" class=\"b\">11:20</a>."}
