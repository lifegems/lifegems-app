The fact that &#x201C;the mountain of the house of Jehovah&#x201D; was to be above mountains and hills would point to the exalted position of true worship, for mountains and hills in ancient times served as sites for idolatrous worship and for sanctuaries of false gods.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/62/0\" data-bid=\"63-1\" class=\"b\">De 12:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/62/1\" data-bid=\"63-2\" class=\"b\"> Jer 3:6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/62/2\" data-bid=\"63-3\" class=\"b\"> Eze 18:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/62/3\" data-bid=\"63-4\" class=\"b\"> 11,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/62/4\" data-bid=\"63-5\" class=\"b\"> 15;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/62/5\" data-bid=\"63-6\" class=\"b\"> Ho 4:13</a>.In a typical fulfillment, between 29 and 70&#xA0;C.E., during the final part of the days of the Jewish system of things, Jehovah&#x2019;s worship was exalted above the lofty elevation that pagan nations gave to their false gods. The King, Jesus Christ, made &#x201C;a breakthrough&#x201D; in elevating the true worship, and he was followed, first by a remnant of the nation of Israel and then by people from all nations.

For example, the obstacles that stood in the way of Israel&#x2019;s returning from Babylonian exile and those that later prevented progress in the temple rebuilding work were compared to mountains.

Therefore, when the psalmist spoke of Jehovah&#x2019;s righteousness as being like &#x201C;mountains of God&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/69/0\" data-bid=\"70-1\" class=\"b\">Ps 36:6</a>) he may have meant that Jehovah&#x2019;s righteousness is immovable. Or, since mountains are lofty, this may point to the fact that God&#x2019;s righteousness by far transcends that of man.
