In some translations a distinction between the geographic designation and the compass direction is not maintained, resulting in confusing renderings. An example of this is <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Genesis 13:1</a>, where translating <em>ne&#x2B9;ghev </em>as &#x201C;south&#x201D; (<em>AS, KJ, Le</em>) makes it appear that Abraham went southward out of Egypt, when actually his direction was northward through the Negeb to Bethel. But this difficulty has been eliminated in many modern translations.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>AT, JB, NW, RS.</em><strong>Topography. </strong>The Negeb of ancient times seems to have embraced an area extending from the district of Beer-sheba in the N to Kadesh-barnea in the S. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 21:14;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/4/1\" data-bid=\"5-2\" class=\"b\"> Nu 13:17,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/4/2\" data-bid=\"5-3\" class=\"b\"> 22;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/4/3\" data-bid=\"5-4\" class=\"b\"> 32:8</a>) The prophet Isaiah described this region as a land of hard conditions, a haunt of lions, leopards, and snakes. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Isa 30:6</a>) In the northern section, occasional springs, wells, and pools are found, and the tamarisk is one of the few trees that thrives there. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 21:33</a>) To the SW of Beer-sheba lie two small areas and one relatively large area of sand dunes. Much of the Negeb is a plateau between 450 and 600&#xA0;m (1,500 and 2,000&#xA0;ft) above sea level, with peaks up to 1,050&#xA0;m (3,440&#xA0;ft) in elevation. To the S and E of Beer-sheba there are rugged ridges, generally running from E to W.<strong>History. </strong>The cisterns, terrace walls, and ruins of many towns that have been found in the Negeb indicate that the area anciently supported a considerable population. Here the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac found pasturage for their large flocks.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/11/0\" data-bid=\"12-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 19:1-6</a>) Also, the nomadic Kenites, who were <span id=\"page485\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"485\" data-before-text=\"485\"></span>related to Moses through marriage, took up residence in the Negeb.

The Israelites evidently did not maintain control over the area. Over the years there were repeated clashes with the Canaanites of the Negeb and particularly with the Amalekites.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003209/15/0\" data-bid=\"16-1\" class=\"b\">1Sa 27:5-8</a>) Apparently not until David&#x2019;s reign as king, after the defeat of the Edomites, did Israel gain complete control of the Negeb.
