The priesthood was inaugurated in 1512&#xA0;B.C.E. One of its chief functions was the education of the people in God&#x2019;s law. Moses the Levite as mediator was, of course, an instructor of the people in the law of God (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 18:16,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/29/1\" data-bid=\"30-2\" class=\"b\"> 20;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/29/2\" data-bid=\"30-3\" class=\"b\"> 24:12</a>), and the priests, together with the nonpriestly Levites, were charged with the responsibility of seeing that the people understood all the regulations spoken by Jehovah through Moses.

This was done publicly for all the people at the time of the Festival of Booths in the Sabbath year, and here there was no segregation according to age or sex, but all the people, old and young, including the alien resident within the gates and all who could understand, would be gathered together to hear the reading.

Hebrew poetry was not expressed in rhyme but in parallelism of thought, thought rhythm. Powerful metaphors were also used; these were based on natural creation, things familiar to all, even to children. Alphabetic acrostics, in which the letters beginning the verses are arranged in alphabetic order, were employed.

The scribe Ezra was a well-educated man and a Bible copyist.

Further, he undertook a general education of the nation of Israel in God&#x2019;s law. In doing this, he was carrying out his duties as a Levitical priest.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/37/0\" data-bid=\"38-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 8:4-9</a>) The Hebrew copyists, or scribes (Sopherim), were men educated in the Law, and although not all of these were Levites, they came to be most prominent in the instruction of the people. As time went on, however, they brought in many traditions and corrupted the true teaching of God&#x2019;s Word.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/0\">SCRIBE</a>.<strong>Education in the First Century C.E. </strong>Parents continued as the primary ones responsible for the education of their children, especially their earlier education.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Lu 6:8</a>) He had no selfish interests at heart in his teaching, for he was sinless and without guile. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 7:26</a>) He did not teach with the philosophical words of the scribes but used illustrations involving everyday things. For this reason his teachings are still understandable today. His instruction was full of illustrations.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/3\">ILLUSTRATIONS</a>.Jesus&#x2019; teaching included reproof and discipline. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/49/0\" data-bid=\"50-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 8:33</a>) He taught by example as well as by word; thus he personally carried out a vigorous campaign of preaching and teaching. His speech was with an authority that none of the scribes could match; accompanying this was God&#x2019;s holy spirit, which gave his teachings the stamp of heavenly backing, so that he could, with authority and power, command the demons to come out of those who were possessed by them. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/50/0\" data-bid=\"51-1\" class=\"b\">Mr 1:27;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/50/1\" data-bid=\"51-2\" class=\"b\"> Lu 4:36</a>) He was bold and fearless in denouncing false teachers who would hinder others from hearing his teachings.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">Mt&#xA0;23</a>.<strong>Education and the Christian Congregation. </strong>Jesus&#x2019; disciples followed his footsteps in Christian educational work and had success similar to his. <span id=\"page685\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"685\" data-before-text=\"685\"></span>They not only <em>preached </em>the good news of God&#x2019;s Kingdom everywhere but also <em>taught </em>those who would listen. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 2:42</a>) They, like Jesus, were bold and spoke with authority.

They taught in the temple, in synagogues, and from house to house.

He showed that the purpose of all these activities was education, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/56/0\" data-bid=\"57-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 4:11-16</a>) A regular program of education in God&#x2019;s Word was carried on by the congregation, as outlined in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/57/0\" data-bid=\"58-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Corinthians chapter&#xA0;14</a>. All the members of the Christian congregation, even the women, were to be teachers; they were to make disciples of the people of the world. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/58/0\" data-bid=\"59-1\" class=\"b\">Ac 18:26;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/58/1\" data-bid=\"59-2\" class=\"b\"> Heb 5:12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/58/2\" data-bid=\"59-3\" class=\"b\"> Ro 12:7</a>) But within the congregation itself mature men were appointed to oversight, as, for example, Timothy and Titus. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/59/0\" data-bid=\"60-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 2:12</a>) Such men had to be those qualified to teach the congregation and to correct things that may have got out of line. They were to use extraordinary care to ensure that their teaching was accurate and healthful.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/60/0\" data-bid=\"61-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 4:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/60/1\" data-bid=\"61-2\" class=\"b\"> 2Ti 4:2,&#xA0;3;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/60/2\" data-bid=\"61-3\" class=\"b\"> Tit 2:1</a>.On the subject of physical education the Bible has little to say, except that the apostle Paul counsels: &#x201C;For bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/61/0\" data-bid=\"62-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 4:8</a>) Physical activity is required, however, in energetic preaching and teaching, which is encouraged. Jesus did a great deal of walking. So did his disciples; Paul&#x2019;s ministry, for example, included much travel, which in that time meant much walking.The Bible gives limited comment on education of a secular nature. It warns Christians not to involve themselves in philosophies of men nor to take time to delve into foolish and unprofitable questions. It strongly counsels against mental intercourse with those who do not believe God and his Word.

Often some form of education and training was required to equip them for such secular occupation. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/63/0\" data-bid=\"64-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 5:8</a>) But from the history of early Christianity we find that, primarily, they were interested in any legitimate method for getting &#x201C;the good news&#x201D; preached, in Bible education for themselves and all who would hear them. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/64/0\" data-bid=\"65-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 9:16</a>) As Professor E.&#xA0;J.&#xA0;Goodspeed says, in <em>Christianity Goes to Press, </em>(1940, p.&#xA0;111):&#x201C;The Christians from the moment they awoke to the possibilities of publication in spreading their gospel over the world availed themselves of them to the full, not only publishing new books but searching out old ones for publication, and this genius for publication has never forsaken them. It is a mistake to suppose that it began with the discovery of printing; it was a characteristic of Christian attitudes from A.D. 70 on, gathering strength as the great fruitfulness of the method emerged. Even the barbarian invasions and the Dark Ages could not quench it. And it is all an evidence of the tremendous dynamic which informed the whole of early Christian life, which sought not only by deed and word but by all the most advanced techniques of publication to carry the gospel, in its fulness and without reserve, to all mankind.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/4\">SCHOOL</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001260/5\">TUTOR</a>."}
