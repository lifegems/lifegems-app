For example, Jesus said: &#x201C;You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001948/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 22:37</a>) He thus showed that a person&#x2019;s desires, feelings, and <span id=\"page1058\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1058\" data-before-text=\"1058\"></span>emotions must express his love for God, but he must also express that love by the way he uses his mental faculties, as by taking in knowledge of God and Christ.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001948/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 17:3</a>.All such functions, capabilities, emotions, and qualities are ascribed, not to the literal heart organ, but to the figurative heart as representing the total inner personality.<strong>The Heart Can Be &#x201C;Treacherous.&#x201D; </strong>Adam, although perfect, let his heart be enticed; he rejected the truth and turned away from God. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001948/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Jas 1:14,&#xA0;15</a>.)

A person may have been a Christian for many years, have a fine knowledge of the Bible, and feel confident that he can safely handle any situation that may arise. Yet, although he knows full well that an act is wrong and specifically condemned by God&#x2019;s law, the thoughts and desires that he has secretly cherished may entice him into sinful action.For these reasons a Christian, though he knows the truth and may consider himself mature, must remember the treachery that his heart can display and must therefore exercise great care not to place himself in the way of temptation.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001948/36/0\" data-bid=\"37-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 6:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001948/36/1\" data-bid=\"37-2\" class=\"b\"> 1Co 10:8-12</a>.<strong>Serving With &#x201C;a Complete Heart.&#x201D; </strong>The literal heart must be whole to function normally, but the figurative heart can be divided.
