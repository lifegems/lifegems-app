Generally, scholars believe the size of the <em>khoi&#x2B9;nix </em>to be slightly more than a liter or a little less than a U.S. dry quart. Since a denarius was a day&#x2019;s wage in John&#x2019;s time (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003602/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 20:1-12</a>), the selling of grains at such prices would indicate famine conditions."}
