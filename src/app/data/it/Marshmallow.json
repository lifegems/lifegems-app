The woody stems of the marshmallow (<em>Althaea officinalis</em>) measure up to 1.8&#xA0;m (6&#xA0;ft) in height. The plant&#x2019;s large, wide leaves are notched and terminate in a sharp point. Both the stems and the leaves are covered with soft downy hair. The pale-pink, five-petal flowers are about 5&#xA0;cm (2&#xA0;in.) across. In times of famine, the marshmallow&#x2019;s white carrotlike root has been used for food. The sole Scriptural reference to the marshmallow alludes to its tastelessness.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002916/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Job 6:6</a>.The Hebrew term <em>chal&#xB7;la&#xB7;muth&#x2B9;, </em>found only at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002916/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Job 6:6</a>, has been variously rendered &#x201C;egg&#x201D; (<em>AS, KJ</em>), &#x201C;purslain&#x201D; (<em>AT</em>), and, as defined in a Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon by L.&#xA0;Koehler and W.&#xA0;Baumgartner, &#x201C;marsh-mallow&#x201D; (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, </em>Leiden, 1958, p.&#xA0;304)."}
