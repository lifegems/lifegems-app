Furnaces in Bible times were constructed of brick or stone. Circular copper furnaces believed to date from the period of the Judges were found at Tell Qasileh on the northern outskirts of Tel Aviv-Yafo and at Tell Jemmeh (Tel Gamma), S of Gaza. These furnaces were equipped with large mud-brick flues designed to lead air into the fire chamber. Clay crucibles containing copper were set on top of the stone tiles that were placed on the ashes of the fire inside the furnace.Daniel&#x2019;s three faithful Hebrew companions were thrown into a fiery furnace by Nebuchadnezzar for refusing to bow down before the golden image the king had erected.
