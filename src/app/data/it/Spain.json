After visiting the Roman Christians, the apostle Paul hoped to be escorted partway there by his fellow believers in Rome.

However, Clement of Rome stated (c.&#xA0;95&#xA0;C.E.) that Paul came &#x201C;to the extreme limit of the W[est],&#x201D; which could have included Spain. (<em>The Ante-Nicene Fathers, </em>Vol.&#xA0;I, p.&#xA0;6, &#x201C;The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians,&#x201D; chap.&#xA0;V) If he reached that land, the visit probably occurred between Paul&#x2019;s release from his first imprisonment in Rome (c.&#xA0;61&#xA0;C.E.) and his imprisonment there once again in about 65&#xA0;C.E. At that time Spain was under Roman rule. Some identify Tarshish with the southern part of Spain.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004198/0\">TARSHISH</a> No.&#xA0;4."}
