The speed of delivery by couriers (Heb., <em>ra&#xB7;tsim&#x2B9;; </em>literally, runners) was of prime importance. From early times such men were referred to as &#x201C;runners.&#x201D; They are called this at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001050/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">2&#xA0;Chronicles 30:6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001050/0/1\" data-bid=\"1-2\" class=\"b\"> 10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001050/0/2\" data-bid=\"1-3\" class=\"b\"> Jeremiah 51:31</a>.In the Persian Empire fast horses were used, along with relay stations, or posts, where fresh couriers and horses waited to carry important messages on their way.

In the Roman Empire there were stations placed every few kilometers for the couriers where 40 horses were constantly kept. Roman couriers could travel about 160&#xA0;km (100&#xA0;mi) a day, a considerable speed in those times. With this system of post-horses, royal messages could be dispatched to the ends of an empire in a relatively short period of time."}
