One ancient canal ran from the mouth of the cave of the Gihon Spring down the Kidron Valley and around the end of the SE hill to a pool at the junction of the Hinnom and Tyropoeon valleys. The canal&#x2019;s gradient of about 4 or 5&#xA0;mm per meter (less than 0.2&#xA0;in. per yard) produced a slow gentle flow, a feature that would fit &#x201C;the waters of the Shiloah that are going gently.&#x201D; The reference to these &#x201C;waters of the Shiloah&#x201D; at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004038/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Isaiah 8:6</a> is figurative and represents the source of real salvation and security."}
