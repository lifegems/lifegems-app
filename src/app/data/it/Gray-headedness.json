There are infrequent cases of premature graying, but usually it accompanies older age. It is in this latter association that the Hebrew verb <em>siv </em>(grow gray) and more frequently the Hebrew noun <em>seh&#xB7;vah&#x2B9; </em>(gray hairs, gray-headedness, old age) occur in the Bible.

Graying has long been recognized as beyond the power of man or medical science to prevent or remedy. This is a point Jesus Christ made after he said we should not swear by our heads.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001761/7/0\" data-bid=\"8-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 5:36</a>.Hair dyes are not of modern discovery, for they were used by the Greeks and Romans. According to Josephus, it was reported that Herod the Great dyed his graying hair to hide his old age.<wbr>&#x2014;<em>Jewish Antiquities, </em>XVI, 233 (viii,&#xA0;1)."}
