(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004237/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:13</a>) The site was called, in Hebrew, <em>&#x201C;Gabbatha,&#x201D; </em>a word of uncertain derivation and possibly meaning &#x201C;hill,&#x201D; &#x201C;height,&#x201D; or &#x201C;open space.&#x201D; The Greek name for it, <em>Li&#xB7;tho&#x2B9;stro&#xB7;ton </em>(Stone Pavement), may indicate a tessellated pavement, one of ornamental mosaic work.&#x201C;The Stone Pavement&#x201D; where Jesus appeared before Pilate was in some way associated with &#x201C;the governor&#x2019;s palace.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004237/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Joh 19:1-13</a>) It may have been an open area in front of the palace of Herod the Great; some scholars favor identification with a site near or a central court within the Tower of Antonia, NW of the temple grounds. But the exact site of The Stone Pavement remains unknown.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004237/0\">ANTONIA, TOWER OF</a>; <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004237/1\">GOVERNOR&#x2019;S PALACE</a>."}
