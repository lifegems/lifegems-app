The breastplates spoken of were probably those worn by the riders of the horses. Fire red and sulfur yellow are mentioned as the other two breastplate colors. In view of the later statement that the horses breathed out fire, smoke, and sulfur, the hyacinth blue may represent the darkness of smoke, which, along with fire and sulfur, may be destructive to life."}
