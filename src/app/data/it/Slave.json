During the time of his servitude the Hebrew slave was to be treated as a hired laborer. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/27/0\" data-bid=\"28-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:2;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/27/1\" data-bid=\"28-2\" class=\"b\"> Le 25:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/27/2\" data-bid=\"28-3\" class=\"b\"> De 15:12</a>) A Hebrew who sold himself into slavery to an alien resident, to a member of an alien resident&#x2019;s family, or to a settler could be repurchased at any time, either by himself or by one having the right of repurchase. The redemption price was based on the number of years remaining until the Jubilee year or until the seventh year of servitude.

(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/29/0\" data-bid=\"30-1\" class=\"b\">De 15:13-15</a>) If a slave had come in with a wife, the wife went out with him. However, if the master had given him a wife (evidently a foreign woman who would not be entitled to freedom in the seventh year of servitude), she and any children by her remained the property of the master. In such a case the Hebrew slave could choose to remain with his master. His ear would then be pierced with an awl to indicate that he would continue in servitude to time indefinite.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/30/0\" data-bid=\"31-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:2-6;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/30/1\" data-bid=\"31-2\" class=\"b\"> De 15:16,&#xA0;17</a>.<strong><em>Female Hebrew slaves. </em></strong>Certain special regulations applied to a female Hebrew slave. She could be taken as a concubine by the master or designated as a wife for his son. When designated as a wife for the master&#x2019;s son, the Hebrewess was to be treated with the due right of daughters. Even if the son took another wife, there was to be no diminishing of her sustenance, clothing, and marriage due. A failure on the son&#x2019;s part in this respect entitled the woman to her freedom without the payment of a redemption price. If the master sought to have a Hebrewess redeemed, he was not permitted to accomplish this by selling her to foreigners.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/31/0\" data-bid=\"32-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:7-11</a>.<strong><em>Protections and privileges. </em></strong>The Law protected slaves from brutalities. A slave was to be set at liberty if mistreatment by the master resulted in the loss of a tooth or an eye. As the usual value for a slave was 30 shekels (compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/32/0\" data-bid=\"33-1\" class=\"b\">Ex 21:32</a>), his liberation would have meant considerable loss to the master and, therefore, would have served as a strong deterrent against abuse. Although a master could beat his slave, the slave, depending upon the decision of the judges, was to be avenged if he died under his master&#x2019;s beating. However, if the slave lingered on for a day or two before dying<wbr>&#x2014;this indicating that the master had <span id=\"page979\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"979\" data-before-text=\"979\"></span>not intended to kill the slave but to discipline him&#x2014;<wbr>he was not to be avenged.

(Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/34/0\" data-bid=\"35-1\" class=\"b\">Nu 35:16-18</a>.) Therefore, if a slave lingered on for a day or two, there would be reasonable question as to whether the death resulted from the chastisement. A beating with a rod, for example, would not normally be fatal, as is shown by the statement at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/35/0\" data-bid=\"36-1\" class=\"b\">Proverbs 23:13</a>: &#x201C;Do not hold back discipline from the mere boy.

The institution of slavery had the protection of the imperial government. First-century Christians did not take a stand against governmental authority in this matter and advocate a slaves&#x2019; revolt. They respected the legal right of others, including fellow Christians, to own slaves. That is why the apostle Paul sent back the runaway slave Onesimus. Because he had become a Christian, Onesimus willingly returned to his master, subjecting himself as a slave to a fellow Christian. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/42/0\" data-bid=\"43-1\" class=\"b\">Phm 10-17</a>) The apostle Paul also admonished Christian slaves not to take improper advantage of their relationship with believing masters. He said: &#x201C;Let those having believing owners not look down on them, because they are brothers. On the contrary, let them the more readily be slaves, because those receiving the benefit of their good service are believers and beloved.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/43/0\" data-bid=\"44-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 6:2</a>) For a slave to have a Christian master was a blessing, as his owner was under obligation to deal righteously and fairly with him.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/44/0\" data-bid=\"45-1\" class=\"b\">Eph 6:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/44/1\" data-bid=\"45-2\" class=\"b\"> Col 4:1</a>.The acceptance of Christianity by those in servitude placed upon them the responsibility of being better slaves, &#x201C;not talking back, not committing theft, but exhibiting good fidelity.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/45/0\" data-bid=\"46-1\" class=\"b\">Tit 2:9,&#xA0;10</a>) Even if their masters treated them unjustly, they were not to render inferior service.

Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah, and not to men.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/47/0\" data-bid=\"48-1\" class=\"b\">Col 3:22, 23;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/47/1\" data-bid=\"48-2\" class=\"b\"> Eph 6:5-8</a>) Such fine conduct toward their masters prevented bringing reproach upon the name of God, as no one could blame Christianity for producing lazy, good-for-nothing slaves.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/48/0\" data-bid=\"49-1\" class=\"b\">1Ti 6:1</a>.Of course, a slave&#x2019;s &#x2018;obedience in everything&#x2019; could not include disobeying God&#x2019;s law, as that would have meant fearing men rather than God. Wrongdoing by slaves, even when committed at the direction of a superior, would not have &#x2018;adorned the teaching of their Savior, God,&#x2019; but would have misrepresented and disgraced this teaching.

All were anointed by the same spirit and thus shared in the same hope as members of one body.

If granted the opportunity to gain freedom, however, he would take advantage of it and thereby enlarge his sphere of Christian activity.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/51/0\" data-bid=\"52-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 7:21-23</a>.<strong>Enslavement to Sin. </strong>At the time the first man Adam disobeyed God&#x2019;s law, he surrendered perfect control of himself and yielded to the selfish desire to continue sharing association with his sinful wife and pleasing her. Adam&#x2019;s surrendering himself to his sinful desire made this desire and its end product, sin, his master. (Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/52/0\" data-bid=\"53-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 6:16;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/52/1\" data-bid=\"53-2\" class=\"b\"> Jas 1:14, 15</a>; see <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/2\">SIN, I</a>.) He thus sold himself under sin. As all of his offspring were yet in his loins, Adam also sold them under sin. That is why the apostle Paul wrote: &#x201C;I am fleshly, sold under sin.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/53/0\" data-bid=\"54-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 7:14</a>) For this reason there was no way for any of Adam&#x2019;s descendants to make themselves righteous, not even by trying to keep the Mosaic Law. As the apostle Paul put it: &#x201C;The commandment which was to life, this I found to be to death.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/54/0\" data-bid=\"55-1\" class=\"b\">Ro 7:10</a>) The inability of humans to keep the Law perfectly showed that they were slaves to sin and deserving of death, not life.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004160/3\">DEATH</a>.<span id=\"page980\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"980\" data-before-text=\"980\"></span>Only by availing themselves of the deliverance made possible through Jesus Christ could individuals be emancipated or gain freedom from this enslavement.
