It is located S of the SE corner of Jerusalem&#x2019;s wall, at the foot of the western bank of the Kidron Valley about 100&#xA0;m (330&#xA0;ft) S of the junction with the Valley of Hinnom. The well reaches an underground stream or spring, which, after a rain, sometimes flows so abundantly that it raises the level of water to the surface."}
