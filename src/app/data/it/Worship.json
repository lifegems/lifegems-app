True worship of the Creator embraces every aspect of an individual&#x2019;s life. The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians: &#x201C;Whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God&#x2019;s glory.&#x201D;<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">1Co 10:31</a>.When Jehovah God created Adam, He did not prescribe a particular ceremony or a means by which perfect man might approach Him in worship. Nevertheless, Adam was able to serve or worship his Creator by faithfully doing the will of his heavenly Father. Later, to the nation of Israel, Jehovah did outline a certain way of approach in worship, including sacrifice, a priesthood, and a material sanctuary. (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/0\">APPROACH TO GOD</a>.) This, however, had only &#x201C;a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Heb 10:1</a>) The primary emphasis has always been on exercising faith<wbr>&#x2014;doing the will of Jehovah God&#x2014;<wbr>and not on ceremony or ritual.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 7:21;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/2/1\" data-bid=\"3-2\" class=\"b\"> Jas 2:17-26</a>.As the prophet Micah put it: &#x201C;With what shall I confront Jehovah? With what shall I bow myself to God on high? Shall I confront him with whole burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of torrents of oil? Shall I give my firstborn son for my revolt, the fruitage of my belly for the sin of my soul? He has told you, O&#xA0;earthling man, what is good.

However, the context determines in what way the respective words are to be understood.One of the Hebrew words conveying the idea of worship (<em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;vadh&#x2B9;</em>) basically means &#x201C;serve.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 14:4;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\"> 15:13;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/5/2\" data-bid=\"6-3\" class=\"b\"> 29:15</a>) Serving or worshiping Jehovah required obedience to all of his commands, doing his will as a person exclusively devoted to him.

When used with reference to the true God or false deities, the word <em>hish&#xB7;ta&#xB7;chawah&#x2B9; </em>is at times associated with sacrifice and prayer.

The term <em>pro&#xB7;sky&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;o </em>is used in connection with a slave&#x2019;s doing obeisance to a king (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/16/0\" data-bid=\"17-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 18:26</a>) as well as the act Satan stipulated when he offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

But Jesus refused, saying: &#x201C;Go away, Satan! For it is written, &#x2018;It is Jehovah your God you must worship [form of Gr. <em>pro&#xB7;sky&#xB7;ne&#x2B9;o </em>or, in the Deuteronomy account that Jesus was quoting, Heb. <em>hish&#xB7;ta&#xB7;chawah&#x2B9;</em>], and it is to him alone you must render sacred service [form of Gr. <em>la&#xB7;treu&#x2B9;o </em>or Heb. <em>&#x2BD;a&#xB7;vadh&#x2B9;</em>].&#x2019;&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/18/0\" data-bid=\"19-1\" class=\"b\">Mt 4:10;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/18/1\" data-bid=\"19-2\" class=\"b\"> De 5:9;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/18/2\" data-bid=\"19-3\" class=\"b\"> 6:13</a>) Similarly, worship, obeisance, or bowing down to &#x201C;the wild beast&#x201D; and its &#x201C;image&#x201D; is linked with service, for the worshipers are identified as supporters of &#x201C;the wild beast&#x201D; and its &#x201C;image&#x201D; by having a mark either on the hand (with which one serves) or on the forehead (for all to see). Since the Devil gives the wild beast its authority, worshiping the wild beast means, in reality, worshiping or serving the Devil.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/19/0\" data-bid=\"20-1\" class=\"b\">Re 13:4,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/19/1\" data-bid=\"20-2\" class=\"b\"> 15-17;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/19/2\" data-bid=\"20-3\" class=\"b\"> 14:9-11</a>.Other Greek words associated with worship are drawn from <em>eu&#xB7;se&#xB7;be&#x2B9;o, thre&#xB7;skeu&#x2B9;o, </em>and <em>se&#x2B9;bo&#xB7;mai. </em>The word <em>eu&#xB7;se&#xB7;be&#x2B9;o </em>means &#x201C;give godly devotion to&#x201D; or &#x201C;venerate, revere.&#x201D; (See <a href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004630/3\">GODLY DEVOTION</a>.)

Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him.

Instead of relying on sight or touch, the true worshiper exercises faith and, regardless of the place or things about him, maintains a worshipful <span id=\"page1212\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"1212\" data-before-text=\"1212\"></span>attitude. Thus he worships, not with the aid of something that he can see or touch, but with spirit. Since he has the truth as revealed by God, his worship is in agreement with the truth. Having become acquainted with God through the Bible and evidence of the operation of God&#x2019;s spirit in his life, the person who worships with spirit and truth definitely &#x2018;knows what he is worshiping.&#x2019;"}
