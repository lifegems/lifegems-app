Historians consider Gebal, the Byblos of the Greeks, to be one of the oldest cities of the Middle East.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001628/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:5</a>, ftn.Jehovah included &#x201C;the land of the Gebalites&#x201D; among those regions yet to be taken by Israel in Joshua&#x2019;s day. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001628/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 13:1-5</a>) Critics have picked on this as an inconsistency, since the city of Gebal was far N of Israel (c.&#xA0;100&#xA0;km [60&#xA0;mi] N of Dan) and apparently never came under Israelite domination. Certain scholars have suggested that the Hebrew text may be damaged at this verse and <span id=\"page903\" class=\"pageNum\" data-no=\"903\" data-before-text=\"903\"></span>consider that the account anciently read &#x201C;the land adjoining Lebanon,&#x201D; or &#x2018;as far as the border of the Gebalites.&#x2019; However, it should also be observed that Jehovah&#x2019;s promises in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001628/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 13:2-7</a> were <em>conditional. </em>Thus Israel may never have gained Gebal because of its own disobedience.<wbr>&#x2014;Compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001628/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 23:12,&#xA0;13</a>.Gebalites helped Solomon in the 11th&#xA0;century B.C.E. with the preparation of the materials for the temple construction. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001628/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">1Ki 5:18</a>) Jehovah lists the &#x201C;old men of Gebal&#x201D; among those who assisted in maintaining ancient Tyre&#x2019;s commercial might and glory.<wbr>&#x2014;<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001628/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Eze 27:9</a>.<strong>2. </strong>A different Gebal is listed with Ammon and Amalek in <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001628/6/0\" data-bid=\"7-1\" class=\"b\">Psalm 83:7</a>, and thus apparently lay S or E of the Dead Sea. Although its exact location is unknown, some scholars place it in the vicinity of Petra, about 100&#xA0;km (60&#xA0;mi) NNE of the Gulf of <em>&#x2BD;</em>Aqaba."}
