The Greek <em>Septuagint, </em>however, reads &#x201C;Fountain of the Fig Trees.&#x201D;This water source was located along the route Nehemiah took on his first inspection of Jerusalem&#x2019;s broken-down walls. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001560/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:12,&#xA0;13</a>) Since this name is not found again in the Scriptures, the fountain or well, if elsewhere referred to, must be under a different designation. En-rogel is commonly suggested as its alternate name. This could well be, for though En-rogel is a considerable distance down the Kidron Valley, the account simply says that Nehemiah passed &#x201C;in front of the Fountain,&#x201D; and this could mean by the corner of the wall facing En-rogel and within sight of, but still some distance from, the fountain.<wbr>&#x2014;See <a class=\"it\" href=\"/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001560/0\">EN-ROGEL</a>."}
