He is also called &#x201C;the king of Syria.&#x201D; (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001091/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jg 3:7-11</a>) Some view the second half (&#x201C;rishathaim&#x201D;) of this composite name as the name of a place or region, while others translate it to mean &#x201C;Double Wickedness.&#x201D; &#x201C;Cushan&#x201D; is used at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001091/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Habakkuk 3:7</a> to parallel Midian; however, it is stated that King Cushan-rishathaim was from Mesopotamia (Heb., <em>&#x2BC;Aram&#x2B9; na&#xB7;hara&#x2B9;yim; </em>compare <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001091/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ge 24:10</a>, where the same term is used to describe the location of the city of Nahor in Syria). A list of Pharaoh Ramses&#xA0;III mentions a district in northern Syria called Qusanaruma, and this is suggested by some scholars to have been the possible seat of this king&#x2019;s domain. Cushan-rishathaim was Israel&#x2019;s first major oppressor during the period of the Judges."}
