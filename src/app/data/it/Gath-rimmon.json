However, on the basis of the parallel account at <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001621/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Joshua 21:23, 24</a>, Hebrew scholars believe that, because of scribal error, a portion of the text has accidentally dropped out and been lost. So, they suggest inserting the following (corresponding to <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001621/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Jos 21:23</a>) before <a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001621/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">1&#xA0;Chronicles 6:69</a>: &#x201C;And from the tribe of Dan, Elteke and its pasture ground, Gibbethon and its pasture ground&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;&#x201D; This could have been the original reading. However, not to be overlooked is the possibility that Gath-rimmon was a Danite enclave city located within Ephraim&#x2019;s territory.Gath-rimmon is usually identified with Tell Jerisheh (Tel Gerisa), about 8&#xA0;km (5&#xA0;mi) NE of modern Tel Aviv-Yafo.<strong>2. </strong>A city of Manasseh, given to the Kohathite Levites.
