(<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/0/0\" data-bid=\"1-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 9:11</a>) The God of loving-kindness, though, would not leave his people in exile forever. He foretold that they would &#x201C;have to serve the king of Babylon seventy years,&#x201D; after which he would deliver a faithful remnant. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/1/0\" data-bid=\"2-1\" class=\"b\">Jer 25:11, 12;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/1/1\" data-bid=\"2-2\" class=\"b\"> 29:10-14</a>) And not even the seemingly impregnable world power of Babylon could thwart God&#x2019;s stated purpose. The return of the Jewish exiles demonstrates the unerring accuracy with which Jehovah&#x2019;s prophecies are fulfilled.Even before the end of the 70 years of exile, Babylon fell, in 539&#xA0;B.C.E., to the invading armies of Persian King Cyrus. Then, during his first year as ruler of Babylon, Cyrus issued a decree opening the way for the Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/2/0\" data-bid=\"3-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 1:1-4</a>) A remnant that may have numbered 200,000 (including men, women, and children) made the journey, arriving in Judah in 537&#xA0;B.C.E. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/3/0\" data-bid=\"4-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 1:5&#x2013;3:1;</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/3/1\" data-bid=\"4-2\" class=\"b\"> 4:1</a>) Thus the 70 years&#x2019; desolation ended exactly on time!Not all the exiles returned at that time, however. In 468&#xA0;B.C.E., another group of returnees accompanied the priest Ezra, who brought to Jerusalem gifts for the temple. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/4/0\" data-bid=\"5-1\" class=\"b\">Ezr 7:1&#x2013;8:32</a>) Then in 455&#xA0;B.C.E., Nehemiah traveled from Shushan to rebuild Jerusalem&#x2019;s walls. (<a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/5/0\" data-bid=\"6-1\" class=\"b\">Ne 2:5, 6,</a><a href=\"/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/5/1\" data-bid=\"6-2\" class=\"b\">&#xA0;11</a>) As to the exact route followed by the returnees, the Scriptures are silent.
